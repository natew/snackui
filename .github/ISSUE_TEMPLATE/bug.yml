        - If you don't include an actual reproduction, you are a bad person and breaking the rules.
        - You can always create a new Tamagui starter using `npm create tamagui` and then push that somewhere.
        - Be sure to have the reproduction be in its own separate commit.
        - For simpler bugs you can fork [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/starters/next-expo-solito) to reproduce the issue.
        - For simple web bugs, try [this one](https://github.com/tamagui/issue-template-webpack) and run `yarn upgrade` to update tamagui to latest.
        - For native-only bugs, fork this repo and use `apps/kitchen-sink` to reproduce the bug. Once reproduced, submit a PR with the title `[Issue] ...`
