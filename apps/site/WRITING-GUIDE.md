## Writing style

You want to keep the writing style friendly and approachable but professional. Often times we come across documentation that is hard to understand, either because it is too technical or poorly written. Make sure that you have a target audience in mind when you write. If the topic onboards readers onto the technology, then it should be approachable and easy to understand. With it having a low number of technical jargon or none at all.

While writing keep your content straightforward, clear and succinct. This means choosing:

- shorter sentences and paragraphs
- simpler vocabulary and phrases
- less jargon
- fewer assumptions about what the reader already knows
- writing out abbreviations and acronyms in full
- bullet points and section headings to break up chunks of text

If you would like to know if your paragraphs are too long or if the level of English required is too high, use the [Hemmingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to test them. There is no rule for grade level. With that said, please keep your sentences within a grade 9 level as much as possible.

#### Voice and Tone

Different kinds of documentation use different kinds of voices and tones. Our documentation hopes to be approachable by readers at all stages of their journey.

As a general guide you can follow the [Google voice and tone guide](https://developers.google.com/style/tone).

Please avoid the use of "we", "our" or any language convention that includes you as you are not there with the reader. Yes, the documentation should be approachable and inclusive, however, documentation is more instructional than it is conversational.

## Accessibility

It is always a good practice to write documentation that is readable by readers of all language levels. This means writing for:

- non-native English speaking readers.
- a beginner to React Native development or programming in general. Only use technical jargon where absolutely necessary.
- readers that are in a hurry, tired and just came for the solution to a bug.
- readers with cognitive, reading or learning impairments.

Google has a good [guide](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility) on the best practices to follow in order to make your writing more accessible.

## Content types

We're making use of the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach to documentation writing. This approach requires documentation to have 4 distinct parts, namely:

- [Guides](#guides): Which outline how to go about completing certain tasks.
- [tutorials](#tutorials): Which educate readers about the subject matter while showing them how to implement it in a project.
- [Explanations and References](#explanations-and-references): Which clarify and detail how the technology works and how it was built.

#### Guides

When writing user guides, please keep things like steps and procedures short and to the point. There is no need to add fluff to guides, as they are meant for showing the user how to do a specific thing. So keep things succinct and to the subject matter. 

#### Tutorials

Here are some tips to keep in mind when writing contributing to the tutorials:

- Use a consistent and clear writing style.
- Provide code snippets with comments and explanations.
- Include screenshots or diagrams where necessary.
- Encourage readers to practice and experiment on their own.
- Use a logical flow and break down complex topics into digestible sections.
- Provide links to relevant external resources.

#### Explanations and References

Here are some tips to writing good explanations and reference documentation;

- Introduction to Explanations:
	- Start with a brief introduction to the concept.
	- Use plain language and avoid unnecessary jargon.

- Clear and Concise Explanations:
	- Break down complex ideas into manageable sections.
	- Utilize real-world examples or analogies.
	- Include relevant technical details without overwhelming the reader.
	- Maintain a consistent writing style and terminology.

- References:
	- Direct users to authoritative sources for further information.
	- Format links clearly with descriptive anchor text.
	- Include publication dates when applicable.

- Inline Code Comments:
	- Add comments in code examples to explain specific lines.

- Footnotes:
	- Use footnotes sparingly for supplementary information or references.

- Glossary:
	- Consider including a glossary of key terms. Only do this if what you're trying to explain involves a lot of technical jargon.

- Consistency:
	- Maintain a consistent format throughout your documentation.

- Testing and Feedback:
	- Seek feedback from the community to ensure clarity and correctness.

- Revision and Updates:
	- Keep your content current and up to date.
