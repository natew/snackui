## React Native

In [this benchmark](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/starters/benchmark/README.md) Tamagui is within 10% of the speed of vanilla React Native, even when using nearly all of it's features. We render list of 28 items with a few sections, text and images. Average of 5 runs on a Apple M2 Air:

<BenchmarkChartNative />

Running Tamagui without the compiler averages `125ms` or ~12% slower. Note that the compiler is much more effective on the web as it turns many more props into CSS and both bundle size and render performance are more important.

## Web

We forked and ran a few mico [benchmarks](https://github.com/tamagui/benchmarks) on web.

### Simple component

Timing rendering a simple custom component.

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.018 },
    { name: 'React Native', value: 0.057 },
    { name: 'NativeBase', value: 0.67 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.042 },
  ]}
/>

### Updating variants

Changing variants is fast at runtime, and even faster when compiled:

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.02 },
    { name: 'React Native', value: 0.063 },
    { name: 'NativeBase', value: 0.73 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.108 },
  ]}
/>

> Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating inline styles

Tamagui has a big advantage for inline styles, it's the only library to compile them and flatten the tree.

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.025 },
    { name: 'React Native', value: 0.06 },
    { name: 'NativeBase', value: 0.8 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.266 },
  ]}
/>

### Dynamic styles (no compilation)

<Notice>
  React Native compatible components are far more feature-rich than web-only, and these next two
  tests show a really extreme case where nothing can be optimized. We left them in to be up-front,
  but don't think they represent anywhere near a common use case.
</Notice>

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 31.0 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 57.5 },
  ]}
/>

- NativeBase - couldn't get running

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 18.61 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 44.43 },
  ]}
/>

- NativeBase - couldn't get running

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

## Summary

Tamagui greatly increases render performance and even beats most of the fastest web-only style libraries.
