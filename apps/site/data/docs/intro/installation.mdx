description: How to get Tamagui set up.

Tamagui is a full-featured UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`.

If you want a complete set of components designed to build universal apps, use `tamagui`. If you want to build out your own components and don't want any of the `tamagui` components, you can just use `@tamagui/core`. [See the Design Systems guide](/docs/guides/design-systems) for more on how to configure Core.

This document uses `tamagui` as an example, but if you are using `@tamagui/core` you can swap out the import.

#### Saving bundle size for web-only use cases

If you are _only_ targeting the web: `@tamagui/web` is the same library as `@tamagui/core`, except that it drops support for a few React Native specific things, mostly props: namely the `GestureResponderHandlers` and `onLayout` props are absent, and the platform methods on refs like `measureInWindow` are absent. If you are only targeting web, you can swap every reference of `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` in this guide with `@tamagui/web`. Note that you can't use `@tamagui/web` with `tamagui` as the full `tamagui` package relies on many of these props.

### Quick Start

Try out [create-tamagui](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app) for a helpful starter template which comes with `@tamagui/shorthands` and `@tamagui/themes` for easy default configuration:

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

This gives you everything pre-configured for full-stack apps with shared code.

## Install

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

You generally need to configure one or two things: passing the environment variable `TAMAGUI_TARGET` (set to the string `web` or `native`, respectively), and on the web, setting an alias from `react-native` to `react-native-web`.

### Web

To pass the ENV you add it to the beginning of your start script generally like so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "TAMAGUI_TARGET=web webpack"
  }
}
```

Tamagui has plugins that make the rest a bit simpler to set up (and also get you the optimizing compiler) which you can find in the [Compiler Install docs](/docs/intro/compiler-install).

You just want to ensure two things happen: the `TAMAGUI_TARGET` environment variable is passed in, and `react-native` is aliased to `react-native-web` (only if using `tamagui` or other React Native APIs yourself, as core it doesn't have a dependency on react-native at all).

#### Webpack

We also recommend passing in `__DEV__` and `NODE_ENV` if using react-native:

```tsx
config.plugins.push(
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    process: {
      env: {
        TAMAGUI_TARGET: JSON.stringify('web'),
        __DEV__: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'true' : 'false',
        NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
      },
    },
  })
)

config.resolve.alias['react-native$'] = 'react-native-web'
// or react-native-web-lite if using our more modern but less supported version

// set up web extensions
compiler.options.resolve.extensions = [
  '.web.tsx',
  '.web.ts',
  '.web.js',
  '.ts',
  '.tsx',
  '.js',
]
```

#### Vite

```tsx
config.define = {
  __DEV__: `${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? true : false}`,
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
  'process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET': JSON.stringify('web'),
}

config.resolve.alias['react-native'] = 'react-native-web'
// or react-native-web-lite if using our more modern but less supported version

// set up web extensions
config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions = {
  ...config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions,
  resolveExtensions: [
    '.web.js',
    '.web.ts',
    '.web.tsx',
    '.js',
    '.jsx',
    '.json',
    '.ts',
    '.tsx',
    '.mjs',
  ],
  loader: {
    '.js': 'jsx',
  },
}
```

### Native

#### Babel

For native you'd do something like this:

```sh
TAMAGUI_TARGET=native react-native start
```

```sh
TAMAGUI_TARGET=native expo start
```

You'll also need to indicate to Metro and babel to inline TAMAGUI_TARGET like so:

```bash
yarn add babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables
```

Add `transform-inline-environment-variables` to your `babel.config.js` plugins:

```js
// just to ensure TAMAGUI_TARGET is set
process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET = 'native'

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'transform-inline-environment-variables'
  ]
}
```

#### Media Queries

This is also documented in Configuration, but worth noting twice.

`@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media capabilities out of the box to native apps, while on the web it uses native media queries. To enable media queries for React Native, you need to provide matchMedia implementation:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/react-native-media-driver
```

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'

export default createTamagui({
  media: createMedia({
    xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
    // ...
  }),
})
```

### Config file

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project.
You can import `createTamagui` from either `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` depending on which you decide to use.

From there you'll export default the result of `createTamagui` like so:

```tsx
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createFont, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
  fonts: {
    body: createFont({
      family: 'Arial',
      size: {
        // You'll want to fill these values in so you can use them
        // for now, fontSize="$4" will be 14px.
        // You can define different keys, but `tamagui`
        // standardizes on 1-15.
        4: 14,
      },
      lineHeight: {
        4: 16,
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

You'll need to install these packages if you want the Tamagui pre-configured design system:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/shorthands @tamagui/themes
```

For an even quicker start, you can get a full design system with `@tamagui/config`, which we show on the [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) page. That page also goes into more detail on everything `createTamagui` accepts.

### Root export

Import and use the `TamaguiProvider` component as the top component in your app.

```tsx line=8-14
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
// only import this from your web app, not native
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* if you want nice React 18 concurrent hydration, you'll want Suspense near the root */}
      <Suspense>
        <AppContents />
      </Suspense>
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/core/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

### Webpack, Vite and other web bundlers

Each bundler has a plugin that helps automate setup. See these docs for more:

- [Webpack](/docs/intro/compiler-install#webpack)
- [Next.js](/docs/intro/compiler-install#nextjs) ([guide](/docs/guides/next-js))
- [Vite](/docs/intro/compiler-install#vite) ([guide](/docs/guides/vite))
- [Metro](/docs/intro/compiler-install#babel--metro)
- [Expo](/docs/guides/expo)

For a minimal install without any compiler setup, you'll just need to alias `react-native` to `react-native-web` (or `react-native-web-lite` if you're feeling adventurous and want better concurrent mode support and a more up to date RN Animated driver).

For Webpack:

```tsx
config.resolve.alias['react-native$'] = require.resolve('react-native-web')
```

Or alternatively, to `react-native-web-lite`, our more experimental but modern version of react-native-web.

### Other bundlers and frameworks

Remember, Tamagui runs fully at runtime, so you don't need to set up the compiler to start. But because Tamagui imports `react-native` directly, for web platforms you need to configure an alias. And for CSS extraction, on some frameworks like Next.js require extra configuration.

We have a few guides for the compiler that also include setup of any extras for the web:

Just note: you don't need to set up the compiler!

For the web you usually just need to alias `react-native` to `react-native-web` if you are using `@tamagui/core` or `tamagui`. If you are using the lowest level `@tamagui/web` package, which is basically core but without the React Native unified event APIs, you don't need anything else as it doesn't rely on `react-native` at all.

### Done!

You're ready to use Tamagui:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}
```

We recommend [spending time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration) from here, skipping over the Compiler setup. The compiler is optional and should be saved for setting up after you've built something you'd like to test it with.
