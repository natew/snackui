Tamagui is a full-featured UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`.

If you want a complete set of components designed to build universal apps, use `tamagui`. If you want to build out your own components and don't want any of the `tamagui` components, you can just use `@tamagui/core`. [See the Design Systems guide](/docs/guides/design-systems) for more on how to configure Core.

This document uses `tamagui` as an example, but if you are using `@tamagui/core` you can swap out the import.

#### Saving bundle size for web-only use cases

If you are _only_ targeting the web: `@tamagui/web` is the same library as `@tamagui/core`, except that it drops support for a few React Native specific things, mostly props: namely the `GestureResponderHandlers` and `onLayout` props are absent, and the platform methods on refs like `measureInWindow` are absent. If you are only targeting web, you can swap every reference of `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` in this guide with `@tamagui/web`. Note that you can't use `@tamagui/web` with `tamagui` as the full `tamagui` package relies on many of these props.

### Quick Start

Try out [create-tamagui](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app) for a helpful starter template which comes with `@tamagui/shorthands` and `@tamagui/themes` for easy default configuration:

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

This gives you everything pre-configured for full-stack apps with shared code.

## Install

If you want tamagui with all the components:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

If you just want `core` which only exports `Stack` and `Text` components:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

And if you are only targeting web, want to save some bundle size, and are ok going without the React Native specific props like gesture handlers and onLayout, you can just use `web`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/web
```

That's basically it for install. You can now import and start using Tamagui once you [set up the configuration](#quick-configuration). As of version `1.62.0` Tamagui no longer requires any sort of special setup with your bundler.

That said, once you start using libraries from the React Native ecosystem, you likely need some extra setup. Many of them use the special "platform specific" file extensions pattern that React Native recommends, eg having an `index.js` alongside `index.web.js`, in which bundlers need to grab the `index.web.js` when targeting web. Many packages also import `react-native` directly, so if you're targeting web you need to set an alias from `react-native` to `react-native-web`.

Tamagui itself doesn't need any of this, but since you're probably going to add a variety of packages, you eventually may want to use one of the Tamagui bundler plugins.

If you just want to get coding, don't worry about it for now and continue to [quick configuration](#quick-configuration) or [the full configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration).

### Bundler plugins

The bundler plugins generally set up platform specific extension support, alias react-native to react-native-web, and can enable the optimizing compiler.

#### Webpack

You can just use the TamaguiPlugin:

```tsx
const { TamaguiPlugin } = require('tamagui-loader')

config.plugins.push(
  new TamaguiPlugin({
    config: './src/tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['tamagui'], // matching the yarn add you chose above
  }),
)
```

Or manually set it up:

```tsx
// some stuff for react-native
config.plugins.push(
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    process: {
      env: {
        __DEV__: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'true' : 'false',
        NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
      },
    },
  })
)

config.resolve.alias['react-native$'] = 'react-native-web'

// set up web extensions
compiler.options.resolve.extensions = [
  '.web.tsx',
  '.web.ts',
  '.web.js',
  '.ts',
  '.tsx',
  '.js',
]
```

#### Vite

You can just use the plugin:

```tsx
import { tamaguiExtractPlugin, tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

export default {
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tamaguiPlugin(tamaguiConfig),
    // optional:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? tamaguiExtractPlugin(tamaguiConfig) : null,
  ].filter(Boolean),
}
```

Or manually set it up:

```tsx
// for react-native
config.define = {
  __DEV__: `${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? true : false}`,
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
}

config.resolve.alias['react-native'] = 'react-native-web'

// set up web extensions
config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions = {
  ...config.optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions,
  resolveExtensions: [
    '.web.js',
    '.web.jsx',
    '.web.ts',
    '.web.tsx',
    '.mjs',
    '.js',
    '.mts',
    '.ts',
    '.jsx',
    '.tsx',
    '.json'
  ],
  loader: {
    '.js': 'jsx',
  },
}
```

### Native

For React Native or Expo you shouldn't need any plugins unless you're setting up the optimizing compiler which we highly recommend doing only once you're ready to ship your app to production. That install process is explained in the [Compiler installation docs](/docs/intro/compiler-install).

### Quick configuration

For an in-depth setup, check out [the full configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration). This sets you up with the default Tamagui design system which is great for getting started quick:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project:

```tsx
import { config } from '@tamagui/config'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)

// this makes typescript properly type everything based on the config
type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default tamaguiConfig

// depending on if you chose tamagui, @tamagui/core, or @tamagui/web
// be sure the import and declare module lines both use that same name
```

And finally, you just need to add the TamaguiProvider to your root:

```tsx line=8-14
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
// only import this from your web app, not native
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/core/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

### Done!

You're ready to use Tamagui:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Hello world</Button>
}
```

We recommend [spending time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration) from here, skipping over the Compiler setup. The compiler is optional and should be saved for setting up after you've built something you'd like to test it with.
