---

Tamagui is a full-featured UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`.

The instructions here are for using `tamagui`, a more complete set of components designed to build universal apps. It's fully tree-shakeable, so your bundler should only add components you import.

If you'd rather build your own design system on top of core, [see the Design Systems guide](/docs/guides/design-systems).

### Quick Start

Try out [create-tamagui-app](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app) for a helpful starter template which comes with `@tamagui/shorthands` and `@tamagui/theme-base` for easy default shorthands, themes and tokens.

### Install

```bash
yarn add tamagui react-native-web
```

### Environment variables

Be sure to set the environment variable `TAMAGUI_TARGET` to the string `web` or `native`, respectively.

### Config file

Create a `tamagui.config.js` (or ts) file at the root of your project and export default the result of `createTamagui`. To start quickly you can use our pre-made one.

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from '@tamagui/core'
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/theme-base'

export default createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
})
```

The next page, [Configuration](/docs/intro/configuration) explains this file in detail.

### Root export

Import and use the `TamaguiProvider` component as the top component in your app.

```tsx line=8-14
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* if you want nice React 18 concurrent hydration, you'll want Suspense near the root */}
      <Suspense>
        <AppContents />
      </Suspense>
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/intro/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

Finally, you may want to reset your CSS on your web app, we provide a very minimal one you can import. For Next.js apps, do so at the top of your `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'
```

### Done!

You're now ready to use Tamagui, import and use any components:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}
```

### Set up compilation

<Notice>
  For beginners, we recommend skipping to [Configuration](/docs/intro/configuration). The compiler
  requires more time to set up and should only be enabled in production once you have gotten
  everything running.
</Notice>

```bash
# for web, webpack, only:
yarn add tamagui-loader
# for react-native, only:
yarn add @tamagui/babel-plugin
```

### Web

#### Webpack

We have a full example of a [plain, webpack-only repo here](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/sandbox), which should capture the complete configuration more accurately.

Add `tamagui-loader` and set up your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
const { shouldExclude } = require('tamagui-loader')

const tamaguiOptions = {
  config: './tamagui.config.ts',
  components: ['tamagui'],
  importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],
  logTimings: true,
  disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
}

const projectRoot = __dirname

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // Resolve react-native to react-native-web
      'react-native$': require.resolve('react-native-web'),
      'react-native-web$': require.resolve('react-native-web'),
      // @tamagui/rnw exports a couple internal hooks from react-native-web
      // resolve both to CommonJS so they match
      '@tamagui/rnw': require.resolve('@tamagui/rnw'),
      // optional, for svg icons
      'react-native-svg': require.resolve('@tamagui/react-native-svg'),
    }
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        // you'll likely want to adjust this helper function,
        // but it serves as a decent start that you can copy/paste from
        exclude: path => shouldExclude(path, projectRoot, tamaguiOptions),
        use: [
          // optionally thread-loader for significantly faster compile!
          'thread-loader',

          // works nicely alongside esbuild
          {
            loader: 'esbuild-loader',
            options: {
              loader: 'tsx',
              minify: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
            },
          },

          {
            loader: 'tamagui-loader',
            options: tamaguiOptions,
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET': '"web"',
    })
  ]
}
```

- _importsWhitelist_: Tamagui takes a conservative approach to partial evaluation, this field whitelists (matching against both .ts and .js) files to allow files that import them to read and use their values during compilation. Typically colors and constants files.
- _disableExtaction_: Useful for faster developer iteration as themes hot reload more reliably.

#### Next.js

Add `@tamagui/next-plugin` and configure your `next.config.js`.

```js
// note next-compose-plugins somewhat unmaintained
// you can use a simple two-liner instead, see:
// https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins/issues/59#issuecomment-1192523231
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')
const { withTamagui } = require('@tamagui/next-plugin')

export default withPlugins([
  // All options shows are optional, except config:
  withTamagui({
    // Path to your tamagui.config.ts file:
    config: './tamagui.config.ts',

    // Your design system (default: "tamagui")
    components: ['tamagui'],

    // Follow normalized imports matching these file names, attempt to evaluate
    // their exports for static extraction
    importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],

    // display detailed output (default true)
    logTimings: true,

    // disable static extraction, faster to iterate in dev mode (default false)
    disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',

    // disableExtraction only disables optimizations but keeps the debug ability and output
    // if you want faster builds, you can disable tamagui entirely with this (default false)
    disable: false,

    // Exclude react-native-web modules to lighten bundle
    excludeReactNativeWebExports: ['Switch', 'ProgressBar', 'Picker'],

    // The following options are for more unusual configurations

    // By default, we configure webpack to pass anything inside your root or design system
    // to the Tamagui loader. If you are importing files from an external package, use this:
    shouldExtract: (path: string, projectRoot: string) => {
      if (path.includes('../packages/myapp')) {
        return true
      }
    },

    // Many packages give difficulty to the nextjs server-side (node) runtime when un-bundled.
    // for example, tamagui configures aliases like `react-native` => `react-native-web`.
    // if you're running into a module that has errors importing react-native, you'll want to
    // use a custom shouldExcludeFromServer function to include it (or override the default).
    // this is the exact same return type as webpack.externals.
    // returning undefined will let tamagui handle it, boolean or other values to override.
    shouldExcludeFromServer: ({ fullPath, request }) => {
      if (fullPath.includes('my-module')) {
        return `commonjs ${commonjs}`
      }
      if (request === 'some-hard-to-bundle-package') {
        return true
      }
    }
  })
])
```

Note: If running into issues, the environment variable `IGNORE_TS_CONFIG_PATHS` to "true" can fix issues with Tamagui being resolved incorrectly.

See the [Next.js Guide](/docs/guides/next-js) for more details on setting up your app.

### Native

#### React Native

Add `@tamagui/babel-plugin` to your `babel.config.js` plugins:

```js
// only use babel-plugin for native:
process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET = 'native'

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      '@tamagui/babel-plugin',
      {
        components: ['tamagui'],
        config: './tests/lib/tamagui.config.js',
        importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],
        logTimings: true,
        disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
      }
    ],
    // be sure to set TAMAGUI_TARGET
    ['transform-inline-environment-variables', {
      include: 'TAMAGUI_TARGET'
    }]
  ]
}
```

We've noticed errors in other versions (`0.65.5`), so you may want to pin `@types/react-native` to `0.66.6`.

You'll also need to configure support for unimodules either using [the old method](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-unimodules/), or using the [expo package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/).

Tamagui uses `@expo/match-media` and `expo-linear-gradient`, so you'll want `expo` installed to support their modules. Add `expo-linear-gradient` and `expo-screen-orientation` sub-dependencies to your package.json.

#### Expo

[Check out the Expo guide](/docs/guides/expo) for more information on setting up Expo.

### Compiler options

The webpack loader and Next.js plugin accept the same configuration options:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'config',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      description:
        'Relative path to your tamagui.config.ts file which should export default the result from createTamagui.',
    },
    {
      name: 'components',
      required: false,
      type: 'string[]',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: "['tamagui']",
      description:
        'Array of npm modules containing Tamagui components which youll be using in your app. For example:  if you are using the base Tamagui components. This directs the compiler to load and optimize.',
    },
    {
      name: 'importsWhitelist',
      required: false,
      type: 'string[]',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      description: `Array of whitelisted file paths (always end in .js) which the compiler may try and import and parse at build-time. It is normalized to ".js" ending for all file extensions (js, jsx, tsx, ts). This usually should be set to something like ['constants.js', 'colors.js'] for example, where you have a couple mostly static files of constants that are used as default values for styles.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'logTimings',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: true,
      description:
        'Tamagui outputs information for each file it compiles on how long it took to run, how many components it optimized, and how many it flattened. Set to false to disable these logs.',
    },
    {
      name: 'disableExtraction',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: false,
      description:
        'Disable extraction to CSS completely, instead fully relying on runtime. Setting this to true speed up development as generally your app will hot reload the Tamagui configuration itself.',
    },
    {
      name: 'disableDebugAttr',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: false,
      description:
        'If enabled along with disableExtraction, all parsing will turn off. Normally turning off disableExtraction will keep the helpful debug attributes in DOM',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Web-only configurations

If you want autocompleted imports of `react-native` without having to install all the weight of react-native, you can set `react-native` version to `0.0.0`, and add `@types/react-native` at the latest version.
