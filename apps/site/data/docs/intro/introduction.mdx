description: Universal styles for React Native and Web
---

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a modular style solution for React - web or native. It aims to
  compete with the best web-only style libraries, while bringing many
  much-needed styling capabilities to React Native.

<GetStarted />

You can pick and choose which parts of Tamagui you use:

#### Core

[`@tamagui/core` is a fully-typed style library in TypeScript with design system support](/docs/core/configuration),
a bit like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) or
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but supporting a superset of the the React
Native style API. It brings many nice web style APIs to React Native but with no
dependencies outside of `react` itself, it can also be a great choice for
websites and apps. It weighs 24-28Kb depending on your configuration, but it can
emit near optimal 0-runtime React code with all CSS extracted at build time, and
with 100% [SSR](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr.html) safe code even for features like enterStyle animations.

#### Static

[`@tamagui/static` is an optimizing compiler for React](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler)
that emits 0-runtime, near optimal code for both web and native, even when faced
with logic-filled styles or styles that import values from other files. It was
forked from the great [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle) library.

#### Tamagui

[`tamagui`](/docs/components/stacks) is a suite of components that can come in
styled or unstyled forms, with a few novel components like Adapt, a primitive
that lets a component shapeshift their content into other forms depending on the
media query or platform. It aims to provide a `native` prop for most components,
with limited but growing support.
