description: Universal styles for React Native and Web

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a modular style solution for React - web or native. It aims to compete with
  the best web-only style libraries, while bringing many much-needed styling capabilities
  to React Native.
</IntroParagraph>

<GetStarted />

You can pick and choose which parts of Tamagui you use:

- [`@tamagui/core`](/docs/core/configuration) is a 0-dependency, fully typed style library with some design system features, much like [Stitches](https://stitches.dev)
- [`@tamagui/static`](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler) is a smart optimizing compiler that emits 0-runtime code, even when faced with logic-filled inline styles, forked from [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle)
- [`tamagui`](/docs/components/stacks) is a large suite UI kit with helpful hooks, made to work well and adapt to native platforms and web.

### `@tamagui/core`

Core combines a typed styled CSS-in-JS solution with [createTamagui](/docs/core/configuration) which takes a variety of configuration alongside a complete typed design system consisting of colors, tokens, spacing, sizing, fonts, themes, shorthands, animations, media queries, and more, alongside hooks like [useMedia](/docs/core/use-media) and [useTheme](/docs/core/use-theme) that are all designed to be removable by the compiler.

After [configuring](/docs/core/configuration), use `@tamagui/core` inline:

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const App = () => (
  <View backgroundColor="red" borderRadius={10}>
    <Text color="white">Hello</Text>
  </View>
)
```

or with the `styled` utility:

```tsx
import { View, Theme, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const AvatarCircle = styled(View, {
  // use direct values
  backgroundColor: '#000',

  // or use values typed in createTamagui() themes and tokens
  shadowColor: '$color2',

  pressStyle: {
    scale: 1.05,
  },

  variants: {
    pin: {
      floating: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: '$xs',
        left: '$xs',
      },
    },

    featured: {
      true: {
        scale: 1.1,
        borderRadius: 12,
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

export const App = () => (
  <Theme name="light">
    <AvatarCircle pin="floating" featured />
  </Theme>
)
```

Core also has a complete design system you can set up easily with `createTamagui`.

### `@tamagui/static`

The `@tamagui/static` package is an optimizing compiler that works with `@tamagui/core` taking your styled components and emitting highly optimized code. On the web that looks like CSS and `div` elements, while on native it means hoisted and memoized styles passed to a plain React Native `View`. It can handle even somewhat complex logic-filled styles, and you can easily introspect its output with debug props and pragmas.

[Read more about Static](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler).

### `tamagui`

Above that, [the Tamagui UI Kit](/docs/components/views) for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themeable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.
