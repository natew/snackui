description: How to set up Tamagui with Vite
---

Tamagui now has two plugins for Vite: one that sets up everything you need to get going, and a second that adds CSS compilation. Both are included in the `@tamagui/vite-plugin` package.

### Installation

1. Remove `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` if you have it. (The type module support was removed beacause it was breaking metro, webpack or something).
2. Add `@tamagui/vite-plugin`
3. And update your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { tamaguiExtractPlugin, tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tamaguiPlugin({
      config: './src/tamagui.config.ts',
      components: ['tamagui'],
    }),
    // optional, adds the optimizing compiler:
    tamaguiExtractPlugin(tamaguiConfig),
  ],
})
```

Note: The `tamaguiExtractPlugin` is completely optional and we recommend leaving it out while you set up Tamagui. Once you have build some stuff, you can add it before you go to production.

See the [/docs/intro/installation](Installation) and [/docs/core/configuration](Configuration) docs for more on generally setting up Tamagui.
