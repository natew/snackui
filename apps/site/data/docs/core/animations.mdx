Add animations to Tamagui with an animation driver. See the configuration docs for more on [how to set it up, and how to set up different animation drivers per-platform](/docs/core/configuration#animations).

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using larger but more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without having to change a line outside of configuration.

## Installation

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    medium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    slow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler do the same, ensuring you get all the benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### React Native Animated

[React Native's Animated library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) is the animation library that comes built into React Native and React Native Web.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-react-native
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs off-thread animations, and provides nicer syntax and hooks. It weighs over 100Kb minified though, which makes it not always useful for the web.

<Notice>
  If using the starter, it configures `excludeReactNativeWebExports` to omit FlatList and
  other views reanimated expects, change that config to fix errors.
</Notice>

To install it add to your package.json. We use [Moti](https://moti.fyi) as the driver, which is a very light layer above reanimated:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-moti react-native-reanimated
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile time - reanimated must run via JS.

---

Note the keys match between CSS and reanimated, so you can swap them out.

<Notice>
  **Save bundle size** by removing `Animated` and `AnimatedFlatList` from
  react-native-web. On Next.js, use the [excludeReactNativeWebExports`
  option](/docs/intro/installation#next.js) config option.
</Notice>

### Usage

The `animation` can now accept `slow` as a value. By default, animations will apply to all animatable styles, a lot like setting `all` in a CSS `transition`. Let's test this by setting `hoverStyle`:

Here's an example animating `hoverStyle`:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsHoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsHover

```

### A note on usage

As of beta 150, we're adding a rule for an edge case: any animated component that is _removing or adding_ an animation at any time, keep the `animation` prop defined.

So, `<Square animation={isActive ? 'bouncy' : null} />` rather than `<Square {...isActive && { animation: 'bouncy' }} />`. If you do absolutely need the latter, you must change the `key` at the same time.

Why? The animation hooks are heavy and would otherwise have to run on every component. Plus enter/exit animations further add renders. Tamagui is designed for performance in the happy path. If every component you render had to run all the animation logic, a lot of the performance of Tamagui would be nullified.

### enterStyle

Setting `enterStyle` styles on any component tell it to start with those styles, and immediately transition into their regular styles:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsEnterDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsEnter

```

### Granular animations

The `animation` prop accepts a string or a more complex object to customize animations per-property.

The basic object we'll call an `AnimationConfig`, looks like this:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={{
      // only x and y will apply animations
      x: 'bouncy',
      y: {
        type: 'bouncy',
        overshootClamping: true,
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

Note that values can either map to `AnimationKey` as a string, or to `{ type: AnimationKey, ...configuration }`

You can set a default value using a two-arity array with the default in the first position:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={[
      // all attributes get "bouncy"
      'bouncy',
      // these are customized
      {
        y: 'slow',
        scale: {
          type: 'fast',
          repeat: 2,
        },
      },
    ]}
  />
)
```

### animateOnly

The `animateOnly` prop will limit your animation config to certain keys. It accepts an array of strings that correspond to style property names.

### AnimatePresence and exitStyle

AnimatePresence animates direct children before they unmount. It's inspired by and forked from [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), but works with any animation in Tamagui.

To use with `@tamagui/core`, install and import `@tamagui/animate-presence`. It's already bundled and exported from `tamagui`.

You can use it simply with `enterStyle` + `exitStyle`:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, Stack } from 'tamagui'

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <Stack
        key="my-square"
        animation="bouncy"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        enterStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: 10,
          scale: 0.9,
        }}
        exitStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: -10,
          scale: 0.9
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

<Notice>
  Note you don't even need to set `opacity` on the base style. Tamagui knows to normalize
  styles like opacity and scale to 1 (and y to 0) if it's not defined on the base styles
  but is defined on `enterStyle` or `exitStyle`.
</Notice>

Wrap one or more tamagui components with AnimatePresence. This component will animate on enter and exit.

<Notice>
  Animated child components must each have a unique key prop so AnimatePresence can track
  their presence in the tree.
</Notice>

#### Advanced AnimatePresence Usage

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

AnimatePresence takes two optional special properties, `enterVariant` and `exitVariant`, which allow you to override enterStyle and exitStyle conditionally. These properties would be impossible to change otherwise. This is a simple example, hit "Show Code" for the carousel demo above to see a more practical usage of it:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, Square, styled } from 'tamagui'

const AnimatableSquare = styled(Square, {
  variants: {
    fromRight: {
      true: {
        x: 1000,
      },
    },
    fromLeft: {
      true: {
        x: -1000,
      },
    },
  },
})

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence enterVariant="fromLeft" exitVariant="fromRight">
    {isVisible && (
      <AnimatableSquare
        key="my-square"
        animation="bounce"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        exitStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Note that it will always find the `true` variant and use that. In the future, Tamagui may be able to add support for more flexible variants here.

### What to know when animating

Allowing for spring based animations alongside every other feature of Tamagui has been a challenge. In order to preserve performance while still allowing for this, we've had to make a couple concessions, which are luckily minor.

#### Conditional animations and HMR

The animation hooks are heavy, which initially meant we either had to choose great performance or animations. We've settled on a trade-off. We track if the `animation` prop is set, and if so, we enable the hook. If it _is ever set, even just once_, then the hooks will continue to run for the remainder of the component lifecycle. This means if you ever plan to animate a component you should keep `animation` always set on the component props. You can disable it like so:

```tsx
<Stack animation={condition ? 'animation-name' : undefined} />
```

Note that because of this constraint, you also will see an error if you add the `animation` prop to a component in dev mode during an HMR. Simple reloading the page or triggering another HMR will fix it.

#### AnimatePresence and optimization

If you're using a non-CSS driver + AnimatePresence + have the compiler turned on + are using variant animations like in the carousel demo above (you don't have to worry about `enterStyle` / `exitStyle`, the compiler is smart enough to recognize them and avoid problems), you'll want to add the `disableOptimization` boolean prop to your component to ensure it doesn't flatten during optimization and break your animations.
