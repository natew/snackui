Add animations to Tamagui with an animation driver. See the configuration docs
for more on
[how to set it up, and how to set up different animation drivers per-platform](/docs/core/configuration#animations).

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS
animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using
larger but more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without
having to change a line outside of configuration.

## Installation

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and
runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your
components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    medium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    slow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property
in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler does the same, ensuring you get all the
benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### React Native Animated

[React Native's Animated library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) is the
animation library that comes built into React Native and React Native Web.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-react-native
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an
animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs
off-thread animations, and provides nicer syntax and hooks. It weighs over 100Kb
minified though, which makes it not always useful for the web.

<Notice>
  If using the starter, it configures `excludeReactNativeWebExports` to omit
  FlatList and other views reanimated expects, change that config to fix errors.
</Notice>

To install it add to your package.json. We use [Moti](https://moti.fyi) as the
driver, which is a very light layer above reanimated:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-moti react-native-reanimated
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over
to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile
time - reanimated must run via JS.

---

Note the keys match between CSS and reanimated, so you can swap them out.

<Notice>
  **Save bundle size** by removing `Animated` and `AnimatedFlatList` from
  react-native-web. On Next.js, use the [excludeReactNativeWebExports`
  option](/docs/intro/installation#next.js) config option.
</Notice>

### Usage

The `animation` can now accept `slow` as a value. By default, animations will
apply to all animatable styles, a lot like setting `all` in a CSS `transition`.
Let's test this by setting `hoverStyle`:

Here's an example animating `hoverStyle`:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsHoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsHover

```

### A note on usage

As of beta 150, we're adding a rule for an edge case: any animated component
that is _removing or adding_ an animation at any time, keep the `animation` prop
defined.

So, `<Square animation={isActive ? 'bouncy' : null} />` rather than
`<Square {...isActive && { animation: 'bouncy' }} />`. If you do absolutely need
the latter, you must change the `key` at the same time.

Why? The animation hooks are heavy and would otherwise have to run on every
component. Plus enter/exit animations further add renders. Tamagui is designed
for performance in the happy path. If every component you render had to run all
the animation logic, a lot of the performance of Tamagui would be nullified.

### enterStyle

Setting `enterStyle` styles on any component tell it to start with those styles,
and immediately transition into their regular styles:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsEnterDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsEnter

```

### Granular animations

The `animation` prop accepts a string or a more complex object to customize
animations per-property.

The basic object we'll call an `AnimationConfig`, looks like this:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={{
      // only x and y will apply animations
      x: 'bouncy',
      y: {
        type: 'bouncy',
        overshootClamping: true,
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

Note that values can either map to `AnimationKey` as a string, or to
`{ type: AnimationKey, ...configuration }`

You can set a default value using a two-arity array with the default in the
first position:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={[
      // all attributes get "bouncy"
      'bouncy',
      // these are customized
      {
        y: 'slow',
        scale: {
          type: 'fast',
          repeat: 2,
        },
      },
    ]}
  />
)
```

### animateOnly

The `animateOnly` prop will limit your animation config to certain keys. It
accepts an array of strings that correspond to style property names.

## AnimatePresence

### exitStyle

AnimatePresence animates direct children before they unmount. It's inspired by
and forked from [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), but works
with any animation in Tamagui.

To use with `@tamagui/core`, install and import `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
It's already bundled and exported from `tamagui`.

You can use it simply with `enterStyle` + `exitStyle`:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, View } from 'tamagui'

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <View
        key="my-square"
        animation="bouncy"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        enterStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: 10,
          scale: 0.9,
        }}
        exitStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: -10,
          scale: 0.9,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

<Notice>
  Note you don't even need to set `opacity` on the base style. Tamagui knows to
  normalize styles like opacity and scale to 1 (and y to 0) if it's not defined
  on the base styles but is defined on `enterStyle` or `exitStyle`.
</Notice>

Wrap one or more tamagui components with AnimatePresence. This component will
animate on enter and exit.

<Notice>
  Animated child components must each have a unique key prop so AnimatePresence
  can track their presence in the tree.
</Notice>

### The `custom` prop

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

AnimatePresence also takes a `custom` property that allows you to update a
variant of the animated child before it runs it's exit animation. This is useful
for animating a child out of the screen before it unmounts in a different
direction, like the example above:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence } from '@tamagui/animate-presence'
import { ArrowLeft, ArrowRight } from '@tamagui/lucide-icons'
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Image, XStack, YStack, styled } from 'tamagui'

const GalleryItem = styled(YStack, {
  zIndex: 1,
  x: 0,
  opacity: 1,
  fullscreen: true,

  variants: {
    // 1 = right, 0 = nowhere, -1 = left
    going: {
      ':number': (going) => ({
        enterStyle: {
          x: going > 0 ? 1000 : -1000,
          opacity: 0,
        },
        exitStyle: {
          zIndex: 0,
          x: going < 0 ? 1000 : -1000,
          opacity: 0,
        },
      }),
    },
  } as const,
})

const photos = [
  'https://placekitten.com/500/300',
  'https://placekitten.com/501/300',
  'https://placekitten.com/502/300',
]

const wrap = (min: number, max: number, v: number) => {
  const rangeSize = max - min
  return ((((v - min) % rangeSize) + rangeSize) % rangeSize) + min
}

export function Demo() {
  const [[page, going], setPage] = useState([0, 0])

  const imageIndex = wrap(0, images.length, page)
  const paginate = (going: number) => {
    setPage([page + going, going])
  }

  return (
    <XStack
      overflow="hidden"
      backgroundColor="#000"
      position="relative"
      height={300}
      width="100%"
      alignItems="center"
    >
      <AnimatePresence initial={false} custom={{ going }}>
        <GalleryItem key={page} animation="slowest" going={going}>
          <Image source={{ uri: photos[imageIndex], width: 500, height: 300 }} />
        </GalleryItem>
      </AnimatePresence>

      <Button
        accessibilityLabel="Carousel left"
        icon={ArrowLeft}
        size="$5"
        position="absolute"
        left="$4"
        circular
        elevate
        onPress={() => paginate(-1)}
        zi={100}
      />
      <Button
        accessibilityLabel="Carousel right"
        icon={ArrowRight}
        size="$5"
        position="absolute"
        right="$4"
        circular
        elevate
        onPress={() => paginate(1)}
        zi={100}
      />
    </XStack>
  )
}
```

### What to know when animating

#### Conditional animations and HMR

The animation hooks are heavy, which initially meant we either had to choose
great performance or animations. We've settled on a trade-off. We track if the
`animation` prop is set, and if so, we enable the hook. If it _is ever set, even
just once_, then the hooks will continue to run for the remainder of the
component lifecycle. This means if you ever plan to animate a component you
should keep `animation` always set on the component props. You can disable it
like so:

```tsx
<View animation={condition ? 'animation-name' : null} />
```

Note that because of this constraint, you also will see an error if you add the
`animation` prop to a component in dev mode during an HMR. Often just saving once more will remove the screen, or reloading at worst.

#### SSR safe enter animations for web

Tamagui works hard to make all the animations drivers SSR safe. While the CSS driver is relatively easy, the two others: reanimated, and React Native Web, both require some tricky logic to ensure that they don't flicker, don't hide content for users without JavaScript turned on, and still animation properly on initial render.

The short story is that if you want SSR safe animations, add this somewhere in your `head` tag:

```tsx
<head>
  <script
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      // avoid flash of entered elements before enter animations run:
      __html: `document.documentElement.classList.add('t_unmounted')`,
    }}
  />
</head>
```

##### Perfect SSR

To achieve the ideal behavior for SSR with a spring driver, Tamagui does the following:

1. On server, render using CSS only and with all `enterStyle` off, this way you can use CSS media queries and CSS variables which are a must for the initial render to match on hydration.
2. During that first server render, gather `enterStyle` as atomic CSS with the `.t_unmounted ` selector prefixed.
4. Add the code snippet above to your head, which will ensure the t_unmounted is in place before the browser shows anything visually.
5. On first client render, you have to match the exact server render, so you render once with CSS.
6. Render once more, this time swapping out for the animated spring component, with enterStyle enabled so it matches the initial render.
7. Gather your styles once more with enterStyle turned off, and send the spring drivers happily off to do their bouncy things.
