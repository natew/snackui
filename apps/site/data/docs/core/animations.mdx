Add animations to Tamagui with an animation driver.

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using larger but more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without having to change a line outside of configuration.

## Installation

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    medium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    slow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler do the same, ensuring you get all the benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### React Native Animated

[React Native's Animated library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) is the animation library that comes built into React Native and React Native Web.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-react-native
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs off-thread animations, and provides nicer syntax and hooks. It weighs over 100Kb minified though, which makes it not always useful for the web.

<Notice>
  If using the starter, it configures `excludeReactNativeWebExports` to omit FlatList and other
  views reanimated expects, change that config to fix errors.
</Notice>

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-reanimated
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-reanimated'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile time - reanimated must run via JS.

---

Note the keys match between CSS and reanimated, so you can swap them out.

<Notice>
  **Save bundle size** by removing `Animated` and `AnimatedFlatList` from react-native-web. On
  Next.js, use the [excludeReactNativeWebExports` option](/docs/intro/installation#next.js) config
  option.
</Notice>

### Usage

The `animation` can now accept `slow` as a value. By default, animations will apply to all animatable styles, a lot like setting `all` in a CSS `transition`. Let's test this by setting `hoverStyle`:

Here's an example animating `hoverStyle`:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsHoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsHover

```

### A note on usage

As of beta 150, we're adding a rule for an edge case: anytime you change from animated => not animated, or not animation => animated (eg, you had an `animation="bouncy"` prop and set it to `animation={null}`), you must change the `key` of said component.

Why? Well, because animation drivers are quite heavy. Besides the CSS driver, the others more than double the number of hooks done by any components. And enter/exit animations further add multiple new renders. Tamagui is designed for performance in the happy path. If every component you render has to load all the animation logic, a lot of the performance of Tamagui would be nullified.

Previously, Tamagui used a pattern that was used in Framer Motion, where we loaded an "empty" sub-component when the `animation` prop was set, and then called back with the results. But React doesn't give hard guarantees on the synchronicity of children render order, and in a concurrent world that will be even less stable. So we've moved the animation hook into the body.

Now, we only load the animation hook when you have an `animation` prop set. This means you must change the key when the `animation` prop goes between set and unset to avoid hook ordering issues.

This is a somewhat temporary restriction, as future versions of React should enable us to work around this.

<Notice>
  To re-iterate: as of beta 150, we have added a rule: you must change the `key` of an animated view
  if you are going from having no animation to having an animation, or vice versa.
</Notice>

### enterStyle

Setting `enterStyle` styles on any component tell it to start with those styles, and immediately transition into their regular styles:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsEnterDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsEnter

```

### Granular animations

The `animation` prop accepts a string or a more complex object to customize animations per-property.

The basic object we'll call an `AnimationConfig`, looks like this:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={{
      // only x and y will apply animations
      x: 'bouncy',
      y: {
        type: 'bouncy',
        overshootClamping: true,
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

Note that values can either map to `AnimationKey` as a string, or to `{ type: AnimationKey, ...configuration }`

You can set a default value using a two-arity array with the default in the first position:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={[
      // all attributes get "bouncy"
      'bouncy',
      // these are customized
      {
        y: 'slow',
        scale: {
          type: 'fast',
          repeat: 2,
        },
      },
    ]}
  />
)
```

### animateOnly

The `animateOnly` prop will limit your animation config to certain keys. It accepts an array of strings that correspond to style property names.

### AnimatePresence and exitStyle

AnimatePresence animates direct children before they unmount. It's inspired by and forked from [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), but works with any animation in Tamagui.

To use with `@tamagui/core`, install and import `@tamagui/animate-presence`. It's already bundled and exported from `tamagui`.

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, Square } from 'tamagui'

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <Square
        key="my-square"
        animation="bounce"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        exitStyle={{
          size: 100,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Wrap one or more tamagui components with AnimatePresence. This enables the use the exitStyle prop, whichÂ accepts all style properties and variants, which will be animated to using the `animation` defined before the component is unmounted.

<Notice>
  Animated child components must each have a unique key prop so AnimatePresence can track their
  presence in the tree.
</Notice>

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

AnimatePresence takes two optional special properties, `enterVariant` and `exitVariant`, which allow you to override enterStyle and exitStyle conditionally. These properties would be impossible to change otherwise. This is a simple example, hit "Show Code" for the carousel demo above to see a more practical usage of it:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, Square, styled } from 'tamagui'

const AnimatableSquare = styled(Square, {
  variants: {
    fromRight: {
      true: {
        x: 1000,
      },
    },
    fromLeft: {
      true: {
        x: -1000,
      },
    },
  },
})

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence enterVariant="fromLeft" exitVariant="fromRight">
    {isVisible && (
      <Square
        key="my-square"
        animation="bounce"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        exitStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Note that it will always find the `true` variant and use that. In the future, Tamagui may be able to add support for more flexible variants here.

## Beta

Animations, variants, and static compilation are somewhat at odds in that if we want to extract fully to CSS, we'd remove some information that non-CSS animation drivers want to know.

As of today, we recommend only using variants for animations as they aren't extracted as fully as base-level styled props. In the future, there will likely be a change to Tamagui where you'll need to either indicate animated properties/variants on the `styled()` call itself in some form.
