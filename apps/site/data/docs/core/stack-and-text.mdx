title: Stack & Text
description: The base views of @tamagui/core.
---

Stack and Text are functionally equivalent to React Native `View` and `Text`, they just accept the superset of props that Tamagui supports.

Beyond View, Stack sets `flexDirection` to `column`.

### Props

See [the Props docs](/docs/intro/props) for the full list of properties.

### Usage

You can use them directly:

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Stack margin={10}>
    <Text color="$color">Hello</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

We encourage you to use inline styles. Combined with [shorthands](/docs/core/configuration#shorthands) they can lead to really easy styling, and the Tamagui optimizing compiler will take care of optimizing everything for you so you little to no extra cost in performance:

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Stack mx="$sm" scale={1.2}>
    <Text c="$color">Hello</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

<Notice>
  One really important and useful thing to note about Tamagui style properties: the order
  is important! [Read more here](/docs/core/styled#order-is-important)
</Notice>

### With styled()

You can also use them [with styled](/docs/core/styled) to create your own lower level views that are mean to be re-usable:

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

Inline styles and `styled()` both are optimized by the compiler, so you can author styles using them both depending on the use case.

### Only for web

When set a `defaultFont` is defined int your Tamagusi.config.ts` and its set to be one of key values found inthe correct part of the design system, you basically d

### View

As of version `1.31` Tamagui exports a `View` as well, which has no style properties set by default (as opposed to Stack which sets the flexDirection to column by default).
