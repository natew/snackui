rc.3

- fix alt themes to be more subtle and go less strong to more strong
- animation not changing (between two values or on off?) have to change `key`
- #beatgig - popover not closing
- Adapt.Contents doesn't forward props, if you set `space` above it on `Dialog.Content`
- one full on integration native test unlocks:
  - no more manual checks every release
  - auto release on merge to master
- delay enterStyle

  - https://github.com/ebg1223/t3-tamagui
- site animate mount seems slow
- forms demo textarea top padding + shifts on focus
- play button on mediaplayer in animationsdemo off on mount
- maybe regression in closing popover
- style={{ filter: '' }} broken
  - instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps
    - that way for web all style props pass through automatically
    - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)
- variants intellisense autocomplete not suggesting, but types are right
- tested on FF
  - Card component minor glitch: border flickers on animation end
- #quest-portal - scroll view seems to extend beyond the bottom of the screen making it impossible to access the items at the bottom

1.1

- tama sync
  - make it easy to have a template repo that people sync to
  - includes the git sync stuff from cli now
  - copies/diffs/merges every file there just based on heuristics
  - somehow choose "merge/overwrite/diff"
  - smart defaults
    - package.json etc
    - binary assets overwrite (if not changed, else prompt)

- setup script can power `tama sync` to sync the repo to its parent repo

  - avoid work if matching
  - install into node_modules/.cache (import cacheDir) and symlink next to current file
  - bundle it, use the existing esbuild.buildSync helper fn
  - remove babel use esbuild plugin

yeah tamagui was definitely a rabbit hole, but once it clicked, it's incredible to use. Took me ~2weeks to migrate from native base but was 500% worth it
