rc.1

- maybe regression in closing popover
- style={{ filter: '' }} broken
  - instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps
    - that way for web all style props pass through automatically
    - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)
- variants intellisense autocomplete not suggesting, but types are right
- next load css on subsequent pages
- tested on FF
  - Card component minor glitch: border flickers on animation end
- Stack is producing inline styles for media where YStack produces classname
- Has anyone been successful with enterStyle? I think it has something to do with keys since when I change the key attribute of the letters the animation happens, but after a refresh it does not happen
- #quest-portal - scroll view seems to extend beyond the bottom of the screen making it impossible to access the items at the bottom

1.1

- Is there some way to get color-scheme to update to dark here when we toggle to the dark theme @Nate ?
  - <html class="t_dark" style="color-scheme: light;">
- dynamic eval bundle of smallish fixes: 
  - hash file contents use as hash for tmp file name
  - avoid work if matching
  - install into node_modules/.cache (import cacheDir) and symlink next to current file
  - bundle it, use the existing esbuild.buildSync helper fn
  - remove babel use esbuild plugin

<Menu />

- https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu

  - ios:
    - Zeego uses react-native-ios-context-menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-ios-menu/index.ios.tsx
  - android:
    - Zeego uses
