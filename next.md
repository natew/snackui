- Group is not SSR safe because useProps is evaluating to specific media queries
on the server and then ultimately becomes not-media-css

- Label + Select

- type to search on Select regressed

- masks wasn't exported in my version of @tamagui/theme-builder (1.88.18). I had to grab it from @tamagui/themes/v2-themes instead

- for uni: 
  if you have variant that expands into `maxFontSizeMultiplier` it wont get filtered by skipProps on web

- // TODO: pulling past the limit breaks scroll on native, need to better make ScrollView

- icons move from themed() to just styled()

- nextjs plugin should automatically do the t_unmounted thing if disableSSR isnt true

- opacity values desperately needed
  - dynamic opacity is doable but would only work 0-runtime if css supports shifting opacity

- // TODO ?
- make studio not build unless `studio(` in commit

- native theme change warning logs + theme change speed

- themes v3
  - remove many masks
  - get ready for studio integration (export from studio?)
  - light mode bg's and borders too light in general
  - dark mode kitchen sink the listitem should be lighter than bg, listitem press theme should be darker

- document popover hoverable + onOpenChange second arg via

- add $pointerFine to takeout

- bug in generated icon props
  - https://discord.com/channels/909986013848412191/1178185816426680370/1199854688233857136

- floating ui has a breaking change in patch version, so weve pinned the version to exact, but we should upgrade to latest floating ui and figure out the fixes (last i checked not super easy)

missing disabled prop when using a variant function. Here's an example:

```tsx
const CustomStack = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    selected: {
      ':boolean'(selected, { props }) {
        if (props.disabled) {
         
        }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

onPress

```tsx
const CustomStack = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    disabled: {
      ':boolean': (disabled, { props: { onPress } }) =>
    },
  },
});
```

error when we use aria-selected and aria-disabled inside variants:

```tsx
const CustomStack = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    selected: {
      true: {
        'aria-selected': true,
      },
    },
  },
});

variants changed to feature unset as an option. We set the type as the function argument:

const CustomStack = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    variant: (variant: 'primary' | 'secondary') => {
      return {
        backgroundColor: `$control.${variant}.enabled` as const,
      };
    },
  },
});

type CustomStackProps = GetProps<typeof CustomStack>;

type Variants = CustomStackProps['variant'];
// Used to be 'primary' | 'secondary' | undefined
// Now is 'unset' | 'primary' | 'secondary' | undefined
```

- compiler - no need to setup any separate package

- 2.0 rename SizableStack to Surface and simplify a bit
- 2.0 rename

- make it so media queries can be shared with groups easily

- Remove the need for Text

- document the t_unmounted / SSR
- $theme-light in prod mode SSR issue
- popovers work with no js

- remove proxy worm swap behavior except for whitelisted ones
- TODO
  - process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET === 'native' ? false : props['data-disable-theme']
  - this looks wrong? shouldnt it be the same as on native? we may be doubling them on accident
- Select `ListItemFrame` area is messy/slow due to inline styles and complex components
- propMode

- make styled() only not accept most non-style props

- causes leftover props in DOM:

<Stack
  hitSlop={5}
  onAccessibilityAction={[]}
  importantForAccessibility="no"
  needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing
/>

- useStyle and others can have forComponent types

- docs:
  - for ssr need for t_unmounted
  - explain how ssr works

- tests:
  - SSR e2e with animations
  - onLayout + RN or not
  - active/focus/press styles (+ animations) (+ media queries)
    - we have some of these but more better

- TODO this is duplicated

- this could work automatically? or with a simple config:
const ScrollViewTamagui = styled(ScrollView, {
  bg: '$background',
  contentContainerStyle: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: "$md',
  }
})


studio: add outlineColor and the pseudos
studio: export for takeout option

outlineWidth get smaller at smaller size

studio:
  - Scale / ScaleSelect
    should be a Menu with mini visualizations of the lum/sat scales for each

- gradient style
- "var" mode where it changes types of $ to var(--)
- calc?

- studio:
  - instead of automatic scale:
    - symmetrical (automatic)
    - mirrored (inverses)
  - pre-configure themes
    - stronger, dimmer
    - disabled, active
    - outlined

- get takeout users studio access

- studio color scales first class:
  - adding a color/scale really adds a theme
  - but also adds $colorName1 => $colorNameX to base theme

- check usePropsAndStyle with group props

- studio: the accent color need an accent color that reverses back
- studio: make the scales "anchor" around the selected color better
  - exact color should be at the 14 position always
- studio: add outline, outlineHover, etc
- studio: add partial transparent for each color step?

- // TODO breaks next.js themes page
- alt themes don't change color1-9 so you can't do color2 and then make the alt theme make it more subtle, but they should

- disableClassName breaking css animation
- css animateOnly should always force style tag styles

- 2.0 make it just is the current state with fixes, unstyled across everything, and make various smaller breaking changes in api surfaces that need cleanup
  - recommended config with more strict settings etc
  - a few theme setups you can choose from

- Takeout theme change needs a server restart / theme builder not re-building on changing colors.ts
- Theme reset Button not changing
- ZStack is abs positioning children...

---

Web:

  - createTamagui({ settings: { webMode: true } })
  - No Text/Stack, just `styled.div` ?
  - avoids console warning on Text
  - `@tamagui/style` separate from core
  - instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps
      - that way for web all style props pass through automatically
      - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)
  - have a CSS mode
  - styled('div')
  - avoid flat style props + plugin for styled() control
  - beforeStyles + afterStyles array

---

`style`

  - enables Input taking { autofillSelectedStyle: Style }, or any component accepting a style object as a prop

```tsx
import { Stack, style } from '@tamagui/core'

// make it so style props accepts either a regular style object
// or something like this (can be exported from core):

type StackStyle = {
  base: ViewStyle
  press?: ViewStyle
  hover?: ViewStyle
  focus?: ViewStyle
}

const mySubStyle: StackStyle = style(Stack, {
  backgroundColor: 'red', // optimizes on web to _bg-red

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue', // optimizes on web to _press-bg-blue
  }
})

const MyComponent = (props: { accentedStyle?: StackStyle }) => {
  return (
    <Stack style={[accentedStyle]} />
  )
}


```

---

config: {
    settings: {
      styleStrategy: { type: 'prop', prop: 'sx', acceptFlatStyles: true }
    }
}

---

HEADLESS=1

+ env HEADLESS sets unstyled: true by default
+ createX
+ eject command

---

Smaller features:

  - no-rerender psuedo styles on native when using reanimated driver (fernando PR)
  - imperative methods for many things - sheet, popover, etc, close etc
  - ssr safe themeInverse would be pretty nice
  - styled(ExternalComponent) should always allow Partial props
    - but if you do provide the props ideally it should 'know' they are  pre-filled and therefore not required anymore
    - also it should make sure to make those props required if they aren't set in styled()
  - avoid css extract on server mode next.js?


---

Performance:

  - TAMAGUI_OPTIMIZE_NATIVE_VIEWS on by default using proper prop mapping
  - compiler can add `disableEvents` `disableTheme` to avoid hooks
  - optimization of useTheme/getSplitStyles seems like it has some decent stuff
  - could lazy expand styles
  - get dynamicEval working automatically
  - warn on styled(Pressable) and styled(TouchableOpacity)

---

Studio:

  - Scales
    - All color scales should have an option/check to turn on/off their control over saturation
    - In fact split out saturation scales
    - Remove luminosity slider for base theme just keep for contrast
    - Customize scale popover lets you name a new one, change the values
  - Contrast
    - needs to be able to pick the foreground color manually
    - by default it picks a nice contrast (opposite scale end) foreground
    -
  - Mask themes
    - Need to be fixed in general and improved defaults
  - Final Step
    - Add a final preview set where you can choose any theme for every box section, that way you can preview you main theme + contrast, but also your sub-themes on some boxes, getting very interesting combos
    - Needs to have a overview view of the themes you generated, a grid of cards showing their names, palette, scales, etc, this will be re-used on the purchase page for free/pro themes

  - Post-release
    - Sharing your themes should be a thing, hit publish and it makes the final step overview screen + other users can load it into their studio = more sharing on twitter etc

---

CLI:

  - `tama upgrade` - official tamagui upgrade that works across bundlers
  - `tama doctor` - checks dependencies to be consistent
  - `tamagui [clone|eject] Sheet ./packages/sheet`
    - clones the sheet package into your repo somewhere

---

Components:

  - Native
    - Select
      - iOS Select as well as the newer SwiftUI menu style Picker
    - Sheet native android - https://github.com/intergalacticspacehighway/react-native-android-bottomsheet

  - Menu
  - DatePicker

---

Maintenance:

  - biome checks for react hooks early returns
  - deprecate rnw-lite when we can after making sure all tests / animation drivers pass on rnw
  - TODO this could definitely be done better by at the very minimum
    - this entire proxy could be removed in favor of the proxy we make on initial theme creation, and just having a way to subscribeThemeGet(theme, (key, val) => any) at the useThemeWithState callsite

---

V2:

  - breaking:
    - shorthands
      - col => c
      - remove bg/bc confusion
    - remove suppressHighlighting / margin 0 default from Text
    - compiler can accumulate them and emit a file?
  - basic plugins system
  - no separate UI package necessary for optimization
  - if dynamic eval flattens every usage, remove the definition
  - headless
  - zero runtime

---

# Backlog

- move simple-web to themeBuilder

- Popover.Close inside Sheet

- merge font-size and get-font-sized packages

- cli needs a start update command just runs diff against your `~/.tamagui/tamagui`

- sheet native iOS snapPoints
  - pre release 2.0 version of library
  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal/blob/wip/example/src/examples/Test09.tsx

- CI not failing on type errors in apps/site
a package.json etc etc + zip file

- @alt Sheet inside Popover breaks css animation:
  - https://tamagui.dev/docs/components/popover

- Studio: drag and drop a font and you can configure the subset
  - automatically converts to the right output formats
  - auto generates CSS
  - bundles it into

- <Sheet native />
  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal
  - we'd want expo module + snap points

- <ActionSheet />
 - plus `native` prop https://reactnative.dev/docs/actionsheetios

- add test that builds site for prod + checks for header text / no errors

- Switch unstyled - make it so it doesn't do any theme stuff

- font-family is being output to DOM on text element
- font weights in css are generating extra variables with "undefined" value if not filled in
- add defaultSize and defaultFontFamily to createTamagui
  - all instances of $true can become getConfig().defaultSize
  - all instances of $body can become getConfig().defaultFontFamily
  - remove the validation in createTamagui that enforces the keys

- relative sizing first class (and relative color)
  - add `defaultSize`, and `defaultColor`
  - add `relative()` helpers

- bug: inputs rendering twice due to focusableInputHOC, if you remove that it doesn't, this is due to styled() + how it determines ComponentIn and grabs the component

- document `unstyled` prop for components

- docs for `@tamagui/font` and `@tamagui/theme`

- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/pull/765

- getVariableValue(props.fontFamily) doesn't look right

support new RN props:
https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/01/12/version-071#web-inspired-props-for-accessibility-styles-and-events

Ali:

- [ ] document keyboard avoiding view in `Sheet.mdx`
- [ ] input bug
- [ ] @tamagui/change-animation-driver document
- [ ] Disable warning ENV + configuration.md docs
  - [ ] (nate) make focusStyle border darker
- [ ] bezier on css animations
  - [ ] disablePassBorderRadius feels like a weird thing to need by default
    - change Group's disablePassBorderRadius to something else - perhaps the negation, passBorderRadius? i'm not sure. what do you think about this @natew
    alternatively we could have disablePassBorderRadius default to true only on Tabs.List. but then overriding it would feel awkward (having to pass disablePassBorderRadius={false})
  - [ ] and document on styled() page
- native component modes
  - [ ] `RadioGroup`, `Select` native (web)
  - [ ] `Switch` native (mobile)

---

# Nate

- light/dark theme buttons bad colors (contrast + pressStyle borders)

- add JSDoc help with links to docs for components
  - also can we somehow make intellisense sort the props in a way we want by default? it would be nice to have style props after the others

- Card has a good use case for size being passed through context/css vars
- linear-gradient next.js issue

-  I'm currently using the Selector on Native, and the animation for pulling up the modal is kind of lagging and I get spammed this error when it happens.

- add Themes page in docs under Theme, change Theme => Design System
- move packages to have unstyled
- move packages from /core to /web
- // TODO move into getSplitStyles initial `if (process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET === 'web')` block

----

- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/issues/478
- default light mode theme + not changing
- hoverTheme={false} works, make hoverStyle={false} to unset
- test keyboardavoidingview > scrollView - collapsing tamagui
- check into shadow/elevation not showing
- survey https://tripetto.app or gforms

- unset: useful for unstyled to unset the defaultVariant size

- createThemes accepts array not object
- site _app has t_unmounted helper, move that into tamagui proper

---

2.0

- remove from web (can keep in core or make pluggable):
  - themeable
  - space
  - can have an env setting to exclude all the theme generation stuff if you are using the pre-build: `getThemeCSSRules`
- replace all RN stuff left in tamagui: Image, Input, Spinner, etc
- Accessibility + RTL
- tag="a" should get the typed props of a link
- much better non-monorepo non-expo general setup experience
- app dir support (discussions/409)
- contrastColor (accent color) in themes (discussions/449)
- all: unset

---

- react native pressable in pressable

- tama sync
  - make it easy to have a template repo that people sync to
  - includes the git sync stuff from cli now
  - copies/diffs/merges every file there just based on heuristics
  - somehow choose "merge/overwrite/diff"
  - smart defaults
    - package.json etc
    - binary assets overwrite (if not changed, else prompt)
- setup script can power `tama sync` to sync the repo to its parent repo

  - fixes next.js next load css
  - simplifies initial setup and need for plugins
- site snack + demo embed on all pages floating that scales up on hover on large screengrid or augment
- lighthouse score ci
- pass Size down context (see Group) is this just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)?
- kitchen sink snack on site
- what works for compilation / examples
- @tamagui/sx
- @tamagui/tailwind
- pass Size down context (see Group) but really this is just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)
- native props on more components
- space => gap
- <ActionSheet />
- check deps are matching in compiler startup
- can optimize useMedia / many hooks:
  - https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1576603375814070273
- dual direction scrollview shouldn't need two nested see CodeDemoPreParsed
- container queries
- `variantsOnly: true` on styled(), removes types for anything but variants (and className/theme etc)
- way to use tamagui with custom design system tokens
  - basically map any tokens you choose to internal tamagui ones
- input like button
- allow string values alongside numbers (nativebase port)
- media `$light` and `$dark` for overrides
- built in jsx => css converter
- `tag` => `as` (keep fallback around as deprecated)
  - `as={['a', { ...props }]}`
- breaking change notifier cli
- VSCode => "turn JSX into styled()"
- pass in SharedValue to any prop for animations
- try using react-native-web $css object support for classnames
- animation accept useAnimatedStyle
- Switch gesture
- loadFont, loadAnimations
- <Debug><...><Debug/> turns on debugging for all in tree and shows them nested
- <Icon />
  - use theme values and size values
  - can swap for other icon packs (use createTamagui({ icons }))
- <Autocomplete />

- <GradientText /> can work native with
  - https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view
- react-native-skia / svg image support
- beforeStyle, afterStyle could work ...
  - only if we can do with pseudos:
    - focusStyle={{ after: { fullscreen: true, border... } }}
    - allows for proper focused borders that don't require super hacks
    - see Switch
  - radio may be List.Radio just combines List, Label, Drawer
    - can use Switch or check or custom
- focusWithinStyle
- accessibility upgrades (focus rings etc)
- skeleton just using Theme / variables

---

<Menu />

- https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu
- basically a popover + mouse helpers + built in item element
- don't need sub-menu for first iteration but... could if it's easier to at once
- floating-ui has helpers for this too
- `native` prop to do ContextMenu in iOS
  - ios:
    - Zeego uses react-native-ios-context-menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-ios-menu/index.ios.tsx
  - android:
    - Zeego uses
    - @react-native-menu/menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-android-menu/index.android.tsx

<Skeleton />

<Skeleton />
  <Skeleton.Gradient />
</Skeleton>

```tsx
const Skeleton = styled(Stack, {
  animation: {
    name: 'quick',
    loop: true
  },
  enterStyle: {
    x: '100%',
  },
  exitStyle: {
    x: '-100%',
  },
  background: `linear-gradient(to left, $background, $color, $background)`,
})
```

# Themes

Component themes could force set the actual properties even if they aren't set by the component themselves....

```tsx
themes.dark_Button = {
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'red',

  // is this doable?
  beforeStyle: [{}],
}
```

=

# Winamp Re-skinability

Themes can completely transform the look and feel, a button could have multiple shadows/reflections in one theme, but be totally flat in another.


- 3.0 - single forward pass generates the css alongside the style object

- Fix ToggleGroup active style looking really bad only sticking sometimes
  - in general we need a better system for controlling if we apply active theme or not, or letting consumers control the active styling in general on things
    - perhaps we do active theme by default (unless unstyled: true)
    - <ToggleGroup activeItemProps={{ active: true }}>
    - <ToggleGroup.Item /> then would recieve active={true}?
    - defaults to theme: 'active'

- <Image borderWidth="$2" /> not turning into val via psgeorge

- `import { _ } from '@tamagui/core'`
  - `<_.view />` `<_.text />`
  - put it on globalThis and override type for super quick authoring
  - can extend with your own
    - `<_.p />` `<_.a />` `<.img />` etc
  - can proxy to itself allowing for naming?
    - `<_.view.my-thing />`
  - or boolean variants?
    - `<_.view.p-5.m-10 />`
