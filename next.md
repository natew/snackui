- popover trigger should send an event to close tooltips automatically on open

- we should add a docs page on testing tamagui:

jest-preset.js should add (for testing native):

testEnvironmentOptions: {
  customExportConditions: ['react-native'],
}

- looks like our upgrade to 1.114 added virtualkeyboardpolicy="manual" which broke the auto keyboard appearance on android web, working on a quick fix but wanted to flag

- deeply nested themeInverse needs a fix see kitchen sink squares
- nan issue: nan start or end NaN 22 bytes: 0-22 [ 'bytes: 0', '22' ]

@natew

- button media queries break due to useStyle hook
- algolia creds
- can skip a ton of CSS by disabling prefers color theme setting
  - so long as they use next-theme, or vxrn/color-scheme

@jsherrard

- uniswap/tamagui fixes, see uniswap section
  - the platform-web type issues should be relatively easy
  - fix customization https://discord.com/channels/909986013848412191/1206456825583632384/1274853294195605525


we can turn this pattern:

```
<style
        // @ts-ignore
        precedence="default"
        key="tamagui-css"
        // @ts-ignore
        href="tamagui-css"
      >
        {config.getCSS()}
      </style>
```

into just `{config.getStyleTag()}`

site:

- clicking links fast will crash

uniswap:

- remove boolean for SpaceTokens
  - why is a boolean value allowed for SpaceTokens? I see there's a TODO in the tamagui repo. Is there a way for us to restrict that typecheck in our codebase? Seems really bad if it leads to a crash

- Checkbox disabled prop not disabling on native

- if Popover can not be portaled that would be useful for some use cases

- RadioGroup.Indicator can't use AnimatePresence i think because .styleable()
  - styleable shouldn't probably do anything with presence because the child should expect to handle that, at least need to double check taht

- transform issue:

it looks like transform does not work - console is logging [moti]: Invalid transform value. Needs to be an array. but compiler errors on Types of property 'transform' are incompatible. Type '{ translateX: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Transform | undefined'.

https://linear.app/uniswap/issue/WEB-4733/tamagui-transform-needs-array-to-work-but-type-expects-string

- this isnt applying display flex on lg:


const Layout = styled(Flex, {
  width: '100%',
  maxWidth: 1280,

  '$platform-web': {
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)',
    gridTemplateRows: 'repeat(4, 1fr)',
    gridColumnGap: '16px',
    gridRowGap: '16px',
  },

  $lg: {
    '$platform-web': {
      display: 'flex',
      flexDirection: 'column',
    },
  },
})


- bug: if you name a file `polyfill-native.ts` tamagui-biuld doesnt output the .native files properly

- // @ts-expect-error TODO tamagui needs to add gridArea type
- need to fix web types inside platform web inside media query:
  - $sm={{ "$platform-web": { position: 'fixed' }}
- When using <Adapt.Contents />  inside an Adapt when="sm"  it seems to hide the children before fully closed
  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723409606028379
- When opening a fit Sheet while keyboard is active (at least on ios) the height of the sheet is off
  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723475036176189
- AnimatePresence leaving things in DOM
  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723148309745679
- enter/exit in media not overriding
- not accepting number type in media query: "$platform-web" :{ gridColumnGap: 12 }
- for some reason "$platform-web" :{ gridTemplateRows } not accepted in media uery only
- can't use `mt="1rem"` on web, tried adding allowedStyleValues: 'somewhat-strict-web', still not

postable:

- bring back copy paste on theme tab
- simplification spree



a way to set styles for children:

```tsx
// we could just use classnames?

import { Style } from '@tamagui/core'

const Text = styled(Text, {
  className: 'button-item',
})

const Icon = styled(Text, {
  className: 'button-item',
})

const Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Icon,
  Text
})

const example = (
  <Button gap="$4">
    {/* prefer not renaming so compiler can optimize: */}
    <Style selector=".button-item" color="$color10">
      {/* all of these ðŸ‘‡ get the styles from ^ */}
      <Button.Text /> 
      <Button.Text />
      <Button.Text />
      <Button.Icon $button-hover={{}} />
    </Style>
  </Button>
)
```

v2:

  - // TODO validate these are supported in...
  - // TODO remove in v2
  - // TODO can remove 'web'
  - TODO remove this on v2
  - Text weirdness fixes (explore)
    - remove suppressHighlighting / margin 0 default from Text
    - fix display: inline issue
    - see what react-strict-dom is doing
    - move it to <div><span> where div is flex, span is text only props
        <div {...nonTextStyleProps}>
          <span {...textStylePropsOnly} style={{ display: 'contents' }}>

          </span>
        </div>
  - we have some random web-only props accepts on flat props, we should:
    - either implement them universally if easy
    - or else remove them (in favor of $platform-web)
  - `$platform-` prefixes should go away in favor of just `$web`, `$native` etc
  - textAlignVertical is deprecated but make sure we map back from textAlign to textAlignVertical on v2 and then remove it
  - remove Provider need just global config once
  - @tamagui/cli => tamagui
    - `tamagui build` document/announce
    - `tamagui lint` fix check and document/announce
  - remove deprecated second argument styled acceptsClassName
    - styled(View, { acceptsClassName }, { acceptsClassName })
  - deprecrate and remove mediaPropOrder
  - tamagui => @tamagui/ui
    - new Button, Input (nice, can be v3), Image (image-next), ScrollView
    - note many are headless
    - fullscreen => inset={0}
      - deprecate fullscreen, make sure inset works
  - remove spacer / space / separator
  - remove the accumulation of styleProps in propMapper
  - remove disableRootThemeClass from settings, change to disableRootThemeClassName
  - defaults onlyAllowShorthands to true, themeClassNameOnRoot to true
  - Cleanup Select/ListItem
    - remove SizableStack (maybe rename to Surface), redo/remove ThemeableStack
    - v2-3 ListItem simplification esp for performance of Select
    - fix Select hover/type/performance
  - remove deprecated
  - document react 19 mode - process.env.TAMAGUI_REACT_19
  - react 0.74 alignment:
    - https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74
    - position: 'static'
  - web alignment, accessibility props, "focusable" => tabIndex
  - move to react native flex compat, `styleCompat` default to react-native
    - web alignment?
  - move to web compat style apis
  - no more `as const` needed (ts5) typescript const generic
  - remove deprecated flat settings, prefer createTamagui({ settings: {} })
  - AnimatePresence: remove deprecated props in favor of `custom`
  - remove nativeID, maybe testID
  - remove `dataSet` in favor of `data-` attributes
  - deprecate shadow style props before v2 release and remove in v2
    - "shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".
  - remove as much of `// TODO: remove this in the future when react native a11y API is removed` as possible
    - "Enhance with native semantics" can probably go away right

potential

  - deprecate shadow props separated in favor of boxShadow, implement boxShadow
  - sync AnimatePresence with latest changes from framer-motion
  - group => container

stretch

  - @tamagui/core => @tamagui/style
    - styled()
    - @tamagui/style just style({}) export, takes TextProps

---

v3

  - light-dark()
    - this is an official css thing so would be easy-ish to implement
  - run over components and review for removing some assumptions about `size`
  - disableInjectCSS should maybe just be automated better or defaulted on
  - flat vs style mode, style moves all tamagui styles into `style` besides the other psuedos like hover, enter, etc
  - no react-native deps across the ui kit on web
  - html.div, styled('div'), styled(html.div)
  - zero runtime mode
    - all functional styles pre-generate the styles across the possible tokens (if :number it uses SizeTokens, probably have to disallow string and '...' types but could have a way to define the values at build-time)
  - `<Theme values={{}} />` dynamic override

---

v4 and beyond

- flatMode - no nested objects, everything in flat props
- plugins

---

- Dialog => Sheet adapt performance
  - see // TODO this will re-parent, ideally we would not change tree structure

- SSR safe styled context, something like:

const Context = createStyledContext({
  isVertical: {
    $sm: true,
    $gtSm: false,
  },
})


- seems like vite plugin in basic vxrn app on features/home/HomeLayout.tsx
  - when tamaguiExtract is on, it seems to get stale source code after one save

- useDidFinishSSR can avoid re-renders when disableSSR: true
  - make it export a `disable()` helper we call from tamagui

- Select is using focusScope which React.Children.only erroring in most usages
  - we should try and redo FocusScope to not cloneElement at all and instead wrap with an element + display: contents

- config/v4

  - remove $mono and inter default fonts use system defaults
    - can also export the existing font config as an option for migration
  - must pass in colors separately but it exports the defaults still
  - remove: shouldAddPrefersColorThemes, themeClassNameOnRoot
  - focus styles in the default v3 config are kind of wack
  - automatically handles tree shaking process.env for themes
  - remove some shorthands (shac, less often used ones)

---

- Dialog.Portal and <Dialog modal /> redundant

- as long as you use the nextjs or other new color scheme helpers they always add t_dark/t_light on first render so as long as youre ok with dark mode not working for js-off users, you could turn default the tamagui/config v4 to shouldAddPrefersColorThemes: false

- lower priority uniswap:
  - seems <Switch checked defaultChecked> isnt showing in the checked position
  - <Theme name="dark"> with switch, the thumb is not picking up the right surface color, must be a multiple-nested theme issue

- small win: `useTheme()` could take a theme name to use a diff theme than the current one

- very long classnames could be much shorter:
 - `_borderBottomRightRadius-_platformweb_5037`

- any tamagui component accepts a function callback to handle passing down styles:
    - <View>{(props, style, state) => {}}</View>
    - makes for easy interop, where asChild is more opaque
    - sets disableClassName true

- we need to beef up tests:
  - native in general
  - native/web performance
  - nextjs (can add to code/next-site), esp light/dark/animations
  - $group $platform $theme styling

- uniswap //@ts-expect-error TODO in homepage
- bug in useMedia + compiler
  - https://app.graphite.dev/github/pr/Uniswap/universe/10626/fix-web-toast-alignment

/theme

- generate short url on load
- randomize button for palettes
- OG image of theme card (use the tree one we used for the list of themes in studio)
- save
- use on bento

- can we remove the need for separate Text/View?
    - seems like we could scan just the direct descendents?
    https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/blob/429e2fe1cb9370c59378d9ba1f4a40676bef7555/packages/react-strict-dom/src/native/modules/createStrictDOMComponent.js#L529

- AnimatePresence refactor:
  - https://x.com/mattgperry/status/1816842995758498017?s=46&t=5wFlU_OsfjJ0sQPMFbtG0A

- className merging in variants!
  - `positionSticky: { true: { className: 'position-sticky' } }`
- opacity `/50`
- AnimateList
  - like AnimatePresence but for >1 items
  - AnimatePresence keepMounted={} prop?
  - can handle direction + let you control mount behavior

- remove scroll not working when Dialog adapted to Sheet on mobile
  - we may want Sheet to have its own removeScroll in this case

- AnimatePresence should just work if you change the enterStyle exitStyle dynamically in the render, no need for custom we can capture the props

- popover transform origin
  - https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/floating-ui-react-scale-transform-origin-qv0t1c?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A43%2C25
- Setting default props for any style in a parent (variables dynamic / themes dynamic down the tree)

Nate:

- Popover click outside prop

---

- data-disable-theme is being passed down on web snapshots
- activeTheme props for all components
- in dev mode if no checkbox indicator, warn
  - checkbox should have a default indicator probably with a simple svg check we inline
- move from useMedia match.addListener to addEventListener
- media query height taking into account the "safe height" is important
- https://linear.app/uniswap/issue/EXT-925/tamagui-error-breaking-the-extension
- document Popover.Anchor
- Sometimes press getting stuck still on uniswap moonpay flow
- Text vertical align issue: https://github.com/Uniswap/universe/pull/6730

---

- ( Pending PRs ) RSD / web alignment
  - follow what RSD is doing + dont go beyond native support eg aspect-ratio
  - simple version is good
  - lower priority - em/rem, other nice web styles that rsd/tailwind has
- RSC support
  - just simple views like View/Text/etc + no need for nesting themes
  - need to remove context
- v2 / headless

  - ( Pending PR ) deprecate some createTamagui settings that should move into settings
  - ListItem/Button simplify APIs
  - ( Pending PR ) Image/Input deprecations for web alignment

- native tests (detox?)
- 0-runtime mode
- @tamagui/kit - includes native versions of many things
- remove RNW - Input, Image

---

- Popper arrow logic is bad, needs unstyled support and not to do weird shifting of sizes

---


- No need for View + Text (just Element and we can extend it later)

  - We'd need to mimic text inhertance on native (or remove it on web)
  - https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/blob/429e2fe1cb9370c59378d9ba1f4a40676bef7555/packages/react-strict-dom/src/native/modules/createStrictDOMComponent.js#L529

- <Theme name="dark"> force below root dark causing hydration issues

- Animation + shadowOffset is causing crash in iOS due to object value

  - "auto" too

- Adapt needs public API to support any adaptation

- Select Virtualization

- style()

- i think acceptTokens + compiler not working (see selectionColor)

- settings page in takeout SSR hydration issue due to useThemeSetting

- animatedStyle showing up in animated component snapshot on native

  - add some native snapshots in ci tests

- addTheme updateTheme regression needs a test

- type to search on Select regressed

- // TODO: pulling past the limit breaks scroll on native, need to better make ScrollView

- icons move from themed() to just styled()

- native theme change warning logs + theme change speed

- document popover hoverable + onOpenChange second arg via

- add $mouse to takeout

- bug in generated icon props

  - https://discord.com/channels/909986013848412191/1178185816426680370/1199854688233857136

- compiler - no need to setup any separate package

- Remove the need for Text

- popovers work with no js

- TODO
  - process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET === 'native' ? false : props['data-disable-theme']
  - this looks wrong? shouldnt it be the same as on native? we may be doubling them on accident
- Select `ListItemFrame` area is messy/slow due to inline styles and complex components
- propMode

- make styled() only not accept most non-style props

studio: add outlineColor and the pseudos
studio: export for takeout option

outlineWidth get smaller at smaller size

studio:

- Scale / ScaleSelect
  should be a Menu with mini visualizations of the lum/sat scales for each

- gradient style
- "var" mode where it changes types of $ to var(--)
- calc?

- get takeout users studio access

- studio color scales first class:

  - adding a color/scale really adds a theme
  - but also adds $colorName1 => $colorNameX to base theme

- check usePropsAndStyle with group props

- studio: the accent color need an accent color that reverses back
- studio: make the scales "anchor" around the selected color better
  - exact color should be at the 14 position always
- studio: add outline, outlineHover, etc
- studio: add partial transparent for each color step?

- // TODO breaks next.js themes page
- alt themes don't change color1-9 so you can't do color2 and then make the alt theme make it more subtle, but they should

- disableClassName breaking css animation
- css animateOnly should always force style tag styles

- 2.0 make it just is the current state with fixes, unstyled across everything, and make various smaller breaking changes in api surfaces that need cleanup

  - recommended config with more strict settings etc
  - a few theme setups you can choose from

- Takeout theme change needs a server restart / theme builder not re-building on changing colors.ts
- Theme reset Button not changing
- ZStack is abs positioning children...

---

Web:

- createTamagui({ settings: { webMode: true } })
- No Text/Stack, just `styled.div` ?
- avoids console warning on Text
- `@tamagui/style` separate from core
- instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps
  - that way for web all style props pass through automatically
  - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)
- have a CSS mode
- styled('div')
- avoid flat style props + plugin for styled() control
- beforeStyles + afterStyles array

---

`style`

- enables Input taking { autofillSelectedStyle: Style }, or any component accepting a style object as a prop

```tsx
import { Stack, style } from '@tamagui/core'

// make it so style props accepts either a regular style object
// or something like this (can be exported from core):

type StackStyle = {
  base: ViewStyle
  press?: ViewStyle
  hover?: ViewStyle
  focus?: ViewStyle
}

const mySubStyle: StackStyle = style(Stack, {
  backgroundColor: 'red', // optimizes on web to _bg-red

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue', // optimizes on web to _press-bg-blue
  }
})

const MyComponent = (props: { accentedStyle?: StackStyle }) => {
  return (
    <Stack style={[accentedStyle]} />
  )
}


```

---

config: {
settings: {
styleStrategy: { type: 'prop', prop: 'sx', acceptFlatStyles: true }
}
}

---

HEADLESS=1

- env HEADLESS sets unstyled: true by default
- createX
- eject command

---

Smaller features:

- no-rerender psuedo styles on native when using reanimated driver (fernando PR)
- imperative methods for many things - sheet, popover, etc, close etc
- ssr safe themeInverse would be pretty nice
- styled(ExternalComponent) should always allow Partial props
  - but if you do provide the props ideally it should 'know' they are pre-filled and therefore not required anymore
  - also it should make sure to make those props required if they aren't set in styled()
- avoid css extract on server mode next.js?

---

Performance:

- TAMAGUI_OPTIMIZE_NATIVE_VIEWS on by default using proper prop mapping
- compiler can add `disableEvents` `disableTheme` to avoid hooks
- optimization of useTheme/getSplitStyles seems like it has some decent stuff
- could lazy expand styles
- get dynamicEval working automatically
- warn on styled(Pressable) and styled(TouchableOpacity)

---

Studio:

- Scales
  - All color scales should have an option/check to turn on/off their control over saturation
  - In fact split out saturation scales
  - Remove luminosity slider for base theme just keep for contrast
  - Customize scale popover lets you name a new one, change the values
- Contrast
  - needs to be able to pick the foreground color manually
  - by default it picks a nice contrast (opposite scale end) foreground
  -
- Mask themes
  - Need to be fixed in general and improved defaults
- Final Step

  - Add a final preview set where you can choose any theme for every box section, that way you can preview you main theme + contrast, but also your sub-themes on some boxes, getting very interesting combos
  - Needs to have a overview view of the themes you generated, a grid of cards showing their names, palette, scales, etc, this will be re-used on the purchase page for free/pro themes

- Post-release
  - Sharing your themes should be a thing, hit publish and it makes the final step overview screen + other users can load it into their studio = more sharing on twitter etc

---

CLI:

- `tama upgrade` - official tamagui upgrade that works across bundlers
- `tama doctor` - checks dependencies to be consistent
- `tamagui [clone|eject] Sheet ./packages/sheet`
  - clones the sheet package into your repo somewhere

---

Components:

- Native

  - Select
    - iOS Select as well as the newer SwiftUI menu style Picker
  - Sheet native android - https://github.com/intergalacticspacehighway/react-native-android-bottomsheet

- Menu
- DatePicker

---

Maintenance:

- biome checks for react hooks early returns
- deprecate rnw-lite when we can after making sure all tests / animation drivers pass on rnw
- TODO this could definitely be done better by at the very minimum
  - this entire proxy could be removed in favor of the proxy we make on initial theme creation, and just having a way to subscribeThemeGet(theme, (key, val) => any) at the useThemeWithState callsite

---

# Backlog

- move simple-web to themeBuilder

- Popover.Close inside Sheet

- merge font-size and get-font-sized packages

- cli needs a start update command just runs diff against your `~/.tamagui/tamagui`

- sheet native iOS snapPoints

  - pre release 2.0 version of library
  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal/blob/wip/example/src/examples/Test09.tsx

- CI not failing on type errors in code/tamagui.dev
  a package.json etc etc + zip file

- @alt Sheet inside Popover breaks css animation:

  - https://tamagui.dev/docs/components/popover

- Studio: drag and drop a font and you can configure the subset

  - automatically converts to the right output formats
  - auto generates CSS
  - bundles it into

- <Sheet native />
  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal
  - we'd want expo module + snap points

- <ActionSheet />
- plus `native` prop https://reactnative.dev/docs/actionsheetios

- add test that builds site for prod + checks for header text / no errors

- Switch unstyled - make it so it doesn't do any theme stuff

- font weights in css are generating extra variables with "undefined" value if not filled in
- add defaultSize and defaultFontFamily to createTamagui

  - all instances of $true can become getConfig().defaultSize
  - remove the validation in createTamagui that enforces the keys

- relative sizing first class (and relative color)

  - add `defaultSize`, and `defaultColor`
  - add `relative()` helpers

- bug: inputs rendering twice due to focusableInputHOC, if you remove that it doesn't, this is due to styled() + how it determines ComponentIn and grabs the component

- document `unstyled` prop for components

- docs for `@tamagui/font` and `@tamagui/theme`

- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/pull/765

- getVariableValue(props.fontFamily) doesn't look right

support new RN props:
https://reactnative.dev/blog/2023/01/12/version-071#web-inspired-props-for-accessibility-styles-and-events

Ali:

- [ ] document keyboard avoiding view in `Sheet.mdx`
- [ ] input bug
- [ ] @tamagui/change-animation-driver document
- [ ] Disable warning ENV + configuration.md docs
  - [ ] (nate) make focusStyle border darker
- [ ] bezier on css animations
  - [ ] disablePassBorderRadius feels like a weird thing to need by default
    - change Group's disablePassBorderRadius to something else - perhaps the negation, passBorderRadius? i'm not sure. what do you think about this @natew
      alternatively we could have disablePassBorderRadius default to true only on Tabs.List. but then overriding it would feel awkward (having to pass disablePassBorderRadius={false})
  - [ ] and document on styled() page
- native component modes
  - [ ] `RadioGroup`, `Select` native (web)
  - [ ] `Switch` native (mobile)

---

1.X

- site \_app has t_unmounted helper, move that into tamagui proper

---

2.0

- remove from web (can keep in core or make pluggable):
  - themeable
  - space
  - can have an env setting to exclude all the theme generation stuff if you are using the pre-build: `getThemeCSSRules`
- replace all RN stuff left in tamagui: Image, Input, Spinner, etc
- Accessibility + RTL
- tag="a" should get the typed props of a link

---

- react native pressable in pressable

- `variantsOnly: true` on styled(), removes types for anything but variants (and className/theme etc)
- way to use tamagui with custom design system tokens
  - basically map any tokens you choose to internal tamagui ones
- input like button
- allow string values alongside numbers (nativebase port)
- media `$light` and `$dark` for overrides
- built in jsx => css converter

<Menu />

- https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu
- basically a popover + mouse helpers + built in item element
- don't need sub-menu for first iteration but... could if it's easier to at once
- floating-ui has helpers for this too
- `native` prop to do ContextMenu in iOS
  - ios:
    - Zeego uses react-native-ios-context-menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-ios-menu/index.ios.tsx
  - android:
    - Zeego uses
    - @react-native-menu/menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-android-menu/index.android.tsx

<Skeleton />

<Skeleton />
  <Skeleton.Gradient />
</Skeleton>

```tsx
const Skeleton = styled(Stack, {
  animation: {
    name: 'quick',
    loop: true
  },
  enterStyle: {
    x: '100%',
  },
  exitStyle: {
    x: '-100%',
  },
  background: `linear-gradient(to left, $background, $color, $background)`,
})
```

# Themes

Component themes could force set the actual properties even if they aren't set by the component themselves....

```tsx
themes.dark_Button = {
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'red',

  // is this doable?
  beforeStyle: [{}],
}
```

# Winamp Re-skinability

Themes can completely transform the look and feel, a button could have multiple shadows/reflections in one theme, but be totally flat in another.

- 3.0 - single forward pass generates the css alongside the style object

  - in general we need a better system for controlling if we apply active theme or not, or letting consumers control the active styling in general on things
    - perhaps we do active theme by default (unless unstyled: true)
    - <ToggleGroup activeItemProps={{ active: true }}>
    - <ToggleGroup.Item /> then would recieve active={true}?
    - defaults to theme: 'active'

- `import { _ } from '@tamagui/core'`
  - `<_.view />` `<_.text />`
  - put it on globalThis and override type for super quick authoring
  - can extend with your own
    - `<_.p />` `<_.a />` `<.img />` etc
  - can proxy to itself allowing for naming?
    - `<_.view.my-thing />`
