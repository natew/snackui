Ali todos:
  - [ ] site:
    - [x] github auth redirects to localhost in prod
    - [ ] splash page loads slow on a fresh session because its running supabase before
      - [ ] lets just make `/studio` the splash, and then `studio.tamagui.dev` the studio
      - [ ] see next config rewrites()
    - [ ] studio.tamagui.dev seems like its only SSR and not hydrating?
  - [ ] studio
    - [ ] make it remember dark/light choice (localStorage)

    - [x] Config tab
      - [x] settings:
        - [x] make the boolean ones a XStack with a `<Switch />` on right (not clickable) but show "undefined" faintly next to it if so
        - [x] expanded pane shows a code area with JSON + copy button
      - [x] fonts:
        - [x] multiple "Ag" with each weight
        - [x] the initial view should show them as nice cards sort of like small view but bigger
        - [x] vertical scroll broke (see new SidePane something off there)
      - [x] media query:
        - [x] "xxs" and other keys should be bold, more v height spacing
        - [x] make the rulers always go to the furthest one but be faded out past their final point
        - [x] make the left marker, add an end marker, and make it and the bottom marker all a bit brighter white
        - [x] lets split out max and min into separate sections (just vertically with a header)
      - [x] animations:
        - [x] just link it to the tab (show an external icon thing to right of the title)
      - [x] shorthands:
        - [x] scroll also broken
        - [x] make it two columns on expanded

    - [ ] Colors tab
      - [ ] fix dragging on the HSL lines is wonky

    - [ ] Themes tab
      - [ ] if just "light" or just "dark" is selected and you toggle light/dark on the top right, make the themeId also switch (themeId = whats selected in sidebar)

    - [ ] Tokens tab
      - [ ] lets redo it to be the same structure as settings
      - [ ] once thats done lets also add a new column thats first:
        - [ ] its a wider column
        - [ ] not clickable/openable
        - [ ] lets you visualize the "matching" stuff:
          - [ ] show two `<Square />` vertically
          - [ ] slider to move up/down your tokens
          - [ ] square gets the border radius / size
          - [ ] shows / highlights around the square for "space" tokens
          - [ ] also can show a Button as an option too

    - [ ] all tabs (header):
      - [ ] add a search input box that filters down things as you type

  - [ ] Select native on trigger + native on viewport + accent-color when native (web)
  - [ ] get new starter ready
  - [ ] select: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1071157561757274193/1097795811703791646
  - [ ] low prio: better way to document the "faq" section -> update all docs to use same heading titles, etc.
  - [ ] low prio: toast viewport issue

--------

# Backlog

- @ali make animations SSR properly
  - disable them during SSR (make sure css variables are used), then on hydration turn it on
  - make sure enterStyle still works
  - see t_will-mount
   - hasEnterStyle && ((state.unmounted && needsMount) || !isClient

- @ali Modal doesn't re-enable pointer events until the animation fully completes (popover too?)
  - https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/issues/985

- [ ] bring back static-tests webpack.test.tsx (rename to web.tsx to run) "disabled for now but we really need to bring this back" showing "unknown test" for some reason

- [ ] double render on new button - waiting for fernando's opinion (fernando may do low prio)
- [ ] supabase local -> staging -> prod and migrations setup

- starter is warning "no TAMAGUI_TARGET"

- `tama doctor`
  - probably use @manypky internally
    - https://github.com/Thinkmill/manypkg/blob/main/packages/cli/src/run.ts
  - scan all package.json in monorepo
  - make sure all tamagui versions match
  - watch for non @tamagui stuff like loader
  - auto run this whenever compiler is run as well on startup
  - output nice message

- $web / $native make them work as media queries
- $dark / $light to make adjustments based on mode

- '> Child' descendent queries
  - only with css driver it can extract to css
  - without it uses context

- <Select native />
  - for web this should be pretty straightforward
    - likely want the actual trigger to be styled but the viewport/items to be native

- <Sheet native />
  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal
  - we'd want expo module + snap points

- <ActionSheet />
 - plus `native` prop https://reactnative.dev/docs/actionsheetios

- we should check that things merge properly for regular styled() views the same as `StyledButtonVariantPseudoMerge`, basically try it with regular styled definition. Also try it with inherited styled(styled())

- also â€“ I use the RNW Modal component often. However, I'm not able to use Popover, Tooltip, etc. inside of one. 
  - may need to detect somehow if inside Modal and use it?

- add test that builds site for prod + checks for header text / no errors

- yarn release --canary

- Popover trigger="hover"

- automate adding sponsor label on discord when sponsored
  - if possible we can automate adding a private chat room if they fill our something on their account

- arrow on popover doesnt render border color

- Switch unstyled - make it so it doesn't do any theme stuff

- font-family is being output to DOM on text element
- font weights in css are generating extra variables with "undefined" value if not filled in
- add defaultSize and defaultFontFamily to createTamagui
  - all instances of $true can become getConfig().defaultSize
  - all instances of $body can become getConfig().defaultFontFamily
  - remove the validation in createTamagui that enforces the keys

- <Select /> light mode the hover style is barely visible
  - todo in themes branch
  - it should have pure white bg

- relative sizing first class (and relative color)
  - add `defaultSize`, and `defaultColor`
  - add `relative()` helpers

- missing docs on useToastController().options

- bug android 
  - I've been working on integrating our component library to mobile and ran into a snag with the android build. IOS builds seamlessly and Android throws this error when trying to use Select component:
  - https://discord.com/channels/909986013848412191/1072289484755976312/1093994167601999912

- bug: android styling is different, repro:
  - https://github.com/lostpebble/tamagui-setup-project


- bug: inputs rendering twice due to focusableInputHOC, if you remove that it doesnt, this is due to styled() + how it determines ComponentIn and grabs the component

- document `unstyled` prop for components

- docs for `@tamagui/font` and `@tamagui/theme`

- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/pull/765 

- getVariableValue(props.fontFamily) doesn't look right

- slider track - light theme blends in with bg i think

- Button and other similar ones - make the hover/press/focusStyle zIndex 2, 3, 4 (or all 2) by default

- createInterFont the default weight/letterSpacing should use `true` rather than `4` key (small change just need to test make sure it doens't break)

- lets make forms use outline for 2px borders on focusStyle
  - on native it can just get a darker border but stay 1px

- cli
  - `tamagui doctor` command to check for version mismatch

support new RN props:

Nate:

- refactor getSplitStyles to share getSubStyle / logic with main style logic

- [x] check if bug:
  - one shouldn't work `<YStack onPress><Pressable onPress /></YStack>` - ali: I confirm this works
  - should work `<YStack><Pressable onPress /></YStack>` - ali: I confirm this works
  - result: Pressable is not supported on web since we don't implement usePressability and Pressability - moving it to your section
---

- site polish: 
  - make the text selection match the theme
  - make the link underline match the theme

- website toggle for css/spring doesn't animate? we can keep it outside of the provider ideally so its always spring


- in card : `if (isTamaguiElement(child) && !child.props.size) {` lets convert to context?
  - can we come up with a nicer pattern to avoid having to rewrite from styled() to component here? like some sort of standard way to provide context between components?... thinking out loud:
    - we could have a generic ComponentContext internally in createComponent
    - we can export a createVariantContext()
    - `const CardVariants = createVariantContext<{ size: number }>()`
    - then in Card or any parent you can do `<CardVariants size={} />`
    - finally, in `styled({ variantContext: CardVariants })`

    <CardVariants.Provider size="$10">
      <Card />
    </CardVariants.Provider>

    .for_Card.size_10 .is_Card { ... }

    <Variants skeleton>
      <Card />
    </Variants>

    variants: {
      skeleton: {
        true: {
          beforeStyle: [
            {
              background: 'grey',
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

- themes: outlined, contrast


- light/dark theme buttons bad colors (contrast + pressStyle borders)

- slider track - light theme blends in with bg i think

- add JSDoc help with links to docs for components
  - also can we somehow make intellisense sort the props in a way we want by default? itd be ncie to have style props after the others

- add codesandbox for most components

- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/issues/568
- instead of proxying we could just merge all themes on creation with their parents?

- Card has a good use case for size being passed through context/css vars
- linear-gradient next.js issue

-  I'm currently using the Selector on Native, and the animation for pulling up the modal is kind of lagging and I get spammed this error when it happens.

- add Themes page in docs under Theme, change Theme => Design System
- move packages to have unstyled
- move packages from /core to /web
- // TODO move into getSplitStyles inital `if (process.env.TAMAGUI_TARGET === 'web')` block

----

- check why styled() of a HOC is failing:

- Separator orientation="vertical" deprecate boolean `vertical`

const SheetOverlay = styled(Sheet.Overlay, {
  backgroundColor: '$bgoverlay',
})

- sheet background animation regression
- https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/issues/478
- default light mode theme + not changing
- hoverTheme={false} works, make hoverStyle={false} to unset
- test keyboardavoidingview > scrollView - collapsing tamagui
- check into shadow/elevation not showing
- survey https://tripetto.app or gforms

- unset: useful for unstyled to usnet the defaultVariatn size

---

1.X

- // TODO could be native-only
- Select id="" + Label focus
- web forms events bubble
- theme shouldn't change context ever on web, redo notify()
  - instead of passing ThemeManager in context just pass a UID
    - useChangeTheme can then do listen(UID)
- vertical slider native can be janky
- react native action sheet hooks/logic adapt
- testing native - https://maestro.mobile.dev
- app dir support experimental
- styled('div')
- tooltip auto pass down accessibilityLabel
- accessibility keyboard navigation (Menu component potentially)
- createTamagui({ webOnly: true }) - avoids console warning on Text
  - goes hand in hand with `@tamagui/style` separate from core
- test: useMedia, reanimated, re-renders (mount, on hover, etc), render time ms
- CD on github
- home page sponsors with sizing and better logos
  - https://github.com/JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action
- algolia not indexing some new content
- keyboard search select bug
- variants intellisense autocomplete not suggesting, but types are right
- canary release channel
- improve native integration test
- kitchen-sink in Snack demo link
- `tamagui` cli basic version
- VisuallyHidden + mediaquery + space
- re-render tests:
  - useMedia, component w/ media + style, media + css-style, media + space
  - useTheme, component with theme used in style

- createThemes accepts array not object
- <Theme name="dark_orange" /> type 
- site _app has t_unmounted helper, move that into tamagui proper
- SimpleTooltip no sub theme looks bad on dark mode

---

2.0

- replace all RN stuff left in tamagui: Image, Input, Spinner, etc
- Accessibility + RTL
- tag="a" should get the typed props of a link
- much better non-monorepo non-expo general setup experience
- app dir support (discussions/409)
- contrastColor (accent color) in themes (discussions/449)
- all: unset

---

inbox

- remove defaultVariants in favor of just defaultProps

- // TODO move to validStyleProps to merge
- bundle size reductions:
  - merge mergeSlotProps and mergeProps
  - move to PROP whitelist rather than style whitelist maybe avoid validStyleProps altogether
  - getStylesAtomic "all webkit prefixed rules, pointer-events"
  - color names hardcoded potentially
  - // ??
  - styled(), extendStaticConfig can just merge options rather than de-structure re-structure
  - remove mergeConfigDefaultProps
  - ThemeManager move to functional not class
  - may be able to remove proxyThemeVariables
  - getVariantExtras looks easy to slim
  - reverseMapClassNameToValue / unitlessNumbers
  - normalizeColor etc
  - createPropMapper

- @twaiter Has anyone used a dialog component on mobile? I havent been able to get Dialog.Closed to work (using a button). Seems like the example on the website doesnt work for mobile either (button not there)

- docs search build inline
  - add shorthands to docs
  - make search a nice demo

- tama sync
  - make it easy to have a template repo that people sync to
  - includes the git sync stuff from cli now
  - copies/diffs/merges every file there just based on heuristics
  - somehow choose "merge/overwrite/diff"
  - smart defaults
    - package.json etc
    - binary assets overwrite (if not changed, else prompt)
- setup script can power `tama sync` to sync the repo to its parent repo

- dynamic eval bundle of smallish fixes: 
  - hash file contents cache
  - dont write it as a file, use node vm
  - just use a few find and replace type things for forcing exports, fail if not possible

- site web fonts (can also be a feature of font bundles)
  - https://www.lydiahallie.io/blog/optimizing-webfonts-in-nextjs-13
  - https://simonhearne.com/2021/layout-shifts-webfonts/#reduce-layout-shift-with-f-mods

- drag on switch
- prebuild option
  - de-dupes css
  - fixes next.js next load css
  - simplifies initial setup and need for plugins
- site snack + demo embed on all pages floating that scales up on hover on large screen
- maybe regression in closing popover
- export popover and others internal handles for imperative use
- grid on homepage linking to various nice components maybe replace features grid or augment
- instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps
    - that way for web all style props pass through automatically
    - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)
- lighthouse score ci
- move much logic from withTamgui into TamaguiPlugin
- TestFontTokensInVariants types not autocompleting in variants... but showing properly on hover/type property
- pass Size down context (see Group) is this just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)?
- kitchen sink snack on site
- what works for compilation / examples
- @tamagui/sx
- @tamagui/tailwind
- pass Size down context (see Group) but really this is just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)
- native props on more components
- space => gap
- <ActionSheet />
- check deps are matching in compiler startup
- can optimize useMedia / many hooks:
  - https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1576603375814070273
- dual direction scrollview shouldn't need two nested see CodeDemoPreParsed
- container queries
- `variantsOnly: true` on styled(), removes types for anything but variants (and className/theme etc)
- way to use tamagui with custom design system tokens
  - basically map any tokens you choose to internal tamagui ones
- input like button
- allow string values alongside numbers (nativebase port)
- media `$light` and `$dark` for overrides
- built in jsx => css converter
- `tag` => `as` (keep fallback around as deprecated)
  - `as={['a', { ...props }]}`

- Switch gesture
- loadFont, loadAnimations
- <Debug><...><Debug/> turns on debugging for all in tree and shows them nested
- <Icon />
  - use theme values and size values
  - can swap for other icon packs (use createTamagui({ icons }))
- <Toast />
- <Toggle><Group><Toggle.Item><Item /></Toggle.Item></Group></Toggle>

- <GradientText /> can work native with 
  - https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view
- react-native-skia / svg image support
- beforeStyle, afterStyle could work ...
  - only if we can do with pseudos:
    - focusStyle={{ after: { fullscreen: true, border... } }}
    - allows for proper focused borders that don't require super hacks
    - see Switch
- <Avatar />
  - radio may be List.Radio just combines List, Label, Drawer

<Menu />

- https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dropdown-menu
- basically a popover + mouse helpers + built in item element
- don't need sub-menu for first iteration but... could if it's easier to at once
- floating-ui has helpers for this too
- `native` prop to do ContextMenu in iOS
  - ios:
    - Zeego uses react-native-ios-context-menu
    - https://github.com/nandorojo/zeego/blob/master/packages/zeego/src/menu/create-ios-menu/index.ios.tsx
  - android:

and if you want multiple:

```tsx
const SkeletonVariants = composeVariantProviders(MySquare)
```

# Psuedo Element Styles

- beforeStyles + afterStyles array
- display: flex
- only accepts style props

+++

# Themes

Component themes could force set the actual properties even if they aren't set by the component themselves....

```tsx
themes.dark_Button = {
  borderWidth: 1,
  borderColor: 'red',

  // is this doable?
  beforeStyle: {},
}
```

=

# Winamp Re-skinability

Themes can completely transform the look and feel, a button could have multiple shadows/reflections in one theme, but be totally flat in another.

yeah tamagui was definitely a rabbit hole, but once it clicked, it's incredible to use. Took me ~2weeks to migrate from native base but was 500% worth it
