# Unspaced

<Description>Avoids spacing for children inside a spacing container.</Description>

### Usage

When using `space`, you sometimes want certain children to not contribute to spacing. Use Unspaced to achieve this:

```tsx
import { Text, Unspaced, YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack position="relative" space>
    {/* spaced elements here */}

    {/* avoids extra space at end: */}
    <Unspaced>
      <Text position="absolute">Some absolute positoned text</Text>
    </Unspaced>
  </YStack>
)
```

If you want the item to be visually hidden, use [VisuallyHidden](/docs/components/visually-hidden) instead, which avoids spacing as well as hiding the contents in an accessible manner.
