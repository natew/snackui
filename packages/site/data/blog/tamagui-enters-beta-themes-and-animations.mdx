<IntroParagraph>Tamagui is now in beta üéâ</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui a complete suite of libraries for making cross platform app interfaces on both React and
  React Native at once. Its core is **three libraries**:
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  <UL>
    <LI>A style library (`@tamagui/core`) for creating React Native + Web components.</LI>
    <LI>An optimizing compiler (`@tamagui/static`) for incredible performance.</LI>
    <LI>A component kit (`tamagui`) built using both the above.</LI>
  </UL>
</IntroParagraph>

Since the first alpha it's been six months, [several hundreds of bugfixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0), [three demo apps](https://github.com/tamagui), and a number of new core features. Plus, a totally [refreshed site](/), and a [benchmark suite](/docs/intro/benchmarks).

Lets take a look at the changes in the beta:

### Start faster with create-tamagui-app

Introducing **create-tamagui-app**, to get started much faster with Expo, Next.js, and Tamagui:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

You can even clone + deploy it instantly with Vercel and Github:

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo we borrowed from.

### Overhauled Themes üé®

Themes have been completely redone in an exciting way - they are a huge step forward, a the power and flexibility they have is really unparelleled.

#### Sub-themes

Tamagui already supported sub-themes, with various edge cases. With the rewrite, sub-themes now work much better, and the `theme` prop is available on every component, including ones you create using the `styled` factory function.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack py="$4">
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

#### Component themes

Not only that, but you can give any `styled` component a `name` and it ensure that sub-theme applies. Theme props are now normalized to match React Native style properties as well.

#### Tons of small improvements

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons`, the `Button` component, and the theme engine all work together to automatically handle passing values between each other.

#### Why it matters

I'm really happy with how this landed. This release could have been focused on adding more new components, but it became obvious while working on the newly release [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)/[Popover](/docs/components/popover)/[Drawer](/docs/components/drawer), that we really needed to get the fundamentals right first. It comes down to **animations and themes both having an outsides influence on everything above them**.

In general, UI kits are hard because they have recursive complexity; every implementation detail has an outsize influence the one above it, and features like compilers, media queries, and native support all multiply the amount of code and testing you need to implement.

[Read the docs for much more on themes](/docs/intro/themes).

### Animations

Animations are making their way, experimentally, into `@tamagui/core`. They are unstable, but we want to get feedback and use them more in practice.

<OffsetBox size="hero">
  <XStack py="$4">
    <ExampleAnimations />
  </XStack>
</OffsetBox>

They're implemented as pluggable drivers, starting with two:

- [CSS](/docs/core/animations#css)
- [Reanimated](/docs/core/animations#css)

Which means you can swap entire animation drivers depending on your platform. Want lighter bundles on web, but spring animations on native? Use both packages, and swap them out based on your environment.

[Read the docs on animations](/docs/core/animations) to get started.

### New Components

Over the last few months we've added:

- [Inputs](/docs/components/inputs)
- [Label](/docs/components/label)
- [Switch](/docs/components/switch)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Separator](/docs/components/separator)
- [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse) and [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset)
- [Popover](/docs/components/popover) and [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover)
- [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)
- [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer)
- [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes)
- [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements)

And we're just getting started!

There's tons of room to grow and improve. We're looking at using [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) to improve our floating panels, and getting essential form elements in next.

[Join our Discord to voice which ones you'd like to see](https://discord.gg/4qh6tdcVDa).

### Upgraded Components

[LinearGradient](/docs/components/linear-gradient), [Image](/docs/components/image), and [Button](/docs/components/button) have received lots of love. LinearGradient now fully supports all theme values and the compiler will help it extract any style properties. Image should still be considered beta, but has gone through many rounds of bugfixes and improvements. And Button now handles passing more text properties down, themes and sizes icons more reliably, and has many fixes for variants like `circular`.

### Focus styling

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`.

### ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to have your theme reset to the one above it. ThemeReset does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you're doing automatic light/dark themes - it will still work, but there may be a flash on first load. There's a fix for this that is a bit involved,so we think it's still useful to release as experimental until we land that.

### A pre-made base theme

Use the themes from the Tamagui site itself without any setup at all, simply install `@tamagui/theme-base` and add `themes` and `tokens` to `createTamagui()` in your `tamagui.config.ts`.

Likewise, we've released `@tamagui/shorthands`, a nice default set of shorthands to use out of the box.

### And much more...

- üêõ [Hundreds of bug-fixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1).
- ‚ú® Many docs improvements: new pages, more examples, more props documented, and search.
- ‚ú® Smarter styled() function - now automatically detects Text/View and other React Native Web components and properly handles their styling/types.

### Acknowledgements

This release once again is inspired by or forks code from a variety of other libraries and developers.

I'd like to thank:

- [Fenando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) and [Moti](https://moti.fyi) for the elegant reanimated animation driver that served as the starting point of `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`, as well as for putting together [Solito](https://solito.dev) that powers the first template in create-tamagui-app.
- [Matt Perry](https://twitter.com/mattgperry) and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the base of AnimatePresence in `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for the inspiration of using a nice resizable browser to demo responsive design.
