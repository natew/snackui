<IntroParagraph>Tamagui enters beta üéâ</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui makes making cross platform apps much easier. It's a suite of libraries, but **mainly
  three things**:
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  <UL>
    <LI>A style library (`@tamagui/core`) for creating React Native + Web components.</LI>
    <LI>An optimizing compiler (`@tamagui/static`) for incredible performance.</LI>
    <LI>A component kit (`tamagui`) built using both of the above.</LI>
  </UL>
</IntroParagraph>

It's been six months¬†since the first alpha, [several hundreds of bugfixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0), [three demo apps](https://github.com/tamagui), ten new components, and now a few big new core features. Plus, a [refreshed site](/), a [benchmark suite](/docs/intro/benchmarks), a host of type improvements, and compatibility with more versions of Next.js, Webpack, and React Native.

The two big new pieces in the beta are **Animations**, and **Themes**.

---

## Overhauled Themes üé®

Themes have been completely redone, and they're really fun. They now default to names that map to standard style names with pseudo postfixes, so for `color`, the alternates `colorHover`, `colorFocus`, and `colorPress` are all definable.

Building off that, theme's are now truly nestable - so you can have `dark` and `light`, and below that `dark_blue` and `light_blue`, and then different tints below that (like `dark_blue_alt1`).

<HeroContainer>
  <XStack miw={500} py="$4" ai="center">
    <YStack mx={-16} scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack mx={-16} scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue_alt3" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</HeroContainer>

The `theme` prop is now also available on every component, including ones you create using the `styled` factory function.

Finally, **styled components** actually all will auto-match to a sub-theme of their name - so `Button`, will look for `dark_blue_Button`, allowing you to basically truly control every aspect of your interface, fully typed and changeable at runtime.

Finally, icons and buttons now handle passing themes down automatically.

**I'm really happy with how this landed**. This release could have been focused on new components, but it became obvious while working [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip) / [Popover](/docs/components/popover) / [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer) that **getting animations and themes right** needed to happen first to avoid future pain.

[Read the docs for much more on themes](/docs/intro/themes).

## Animations

Animations are making their way, experimentally, into `@tamagui/core`. They are unstable, but we want to get feedback and use them more in practice.

<OffsetBox my="$4">
  <XStack py="$4">
    <ExampleAnimations />
  </XStack>
</OffsetBox>

They're implemented as pluggable drivers, starting with two:

- [CSS](/docs/core/animations#css)
- [Reanimated](/docs/core/animations#css)

Which means you can swap entire animation drivers depending on your platform. Want lighter bundles on web, but spring animations on native? Install both packages and swap them out based on your environment.

We've also added a new pseudo `enterStyle` that works if you have an `animation` prop set, giving you easy styling on mount (and see the next section for `exitStyle`).

[Read the docs on animations](/docs/core/animations) to get started.

### AnimatePresence

In early form, we've added [AnimatePresence](/docs/core/animations#animate-presence), which is directly forked off Framer Motion. It works with `exitStyle` and variants to make once-complex animations quite easy.

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

## Get started faster üöÄ

Introducing [**create-tamagui-app**](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/create-tamagui-app), to get started much faster with a bootstrapped monorepo that uses Expo, Next.js, Solito and Tamagui:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app
```

You can even clone + deploy it instantly with Vercel and Github:

<XStack my="$4" jc="center">

</XStack>

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo.

## New Components

We've added quite a few new components, and a good portion more are nearing release. Since the alpha we've introduced: [Inputs](/docs/components/inputs), [Label](/docs/components/label), [Switch](/docs/components/switch), [Image](/docs/components/image), [Separator](/docs/components/separator), [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse), [Popover](/docs/components/popover) and [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover), [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip), [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer), [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes), [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements).

Here's the new Switch component working with spring animations:

<HeroContainer>
  <SwitchDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Switch

```

## styled() Upgrades

The `styled()` factory function as well gets many upgrades, it accepts React Native components directly and automatically interprets their props, as well as many fixes - full media query support, _much_ faster/accurate types, and better compilation.

---

## Upgrades

[LinearGradient](/docs/components/linear-gradient), [Image](/docs/components/image), and [Button](/docs/components/button) have received lots of love. LinearGradient now fully supports all theme values and the compiler will help it extract any style properties. Image should still be considered beta, but has gone through many rounds of bugfixes and improvements. And Button now handles passing more text properties down, themes and sizes icons more reliably, and has many fixes for variants like `circular`.

---

## focusStyle

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`. You can see it in action on `Input`:

<HeroContainer>
  <FormsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Forms

```

---

## ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to reset the current theme to the grandparent. [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset) does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you use automatic light/dark themes (it will still work, but it won't fully render until JS runs). There's a fix for this that is a bit involved, but we think it's still useful to release it as experimental.

---

## base-theme

Use the themes from the Tamagui site itself without any setup at all, simply install `@tamagui/theme-base` and add `themes` and `tokens` to `createTamagui()` in your `tamagui.config.ts`.

Likewise, we've released `@tamagui/shorthands`, nice default shorthands out of the box.

---

### Feather Icons

We've released [@tamagui/feather-icons](/docs/components/feather-icons), which have numerous adjustments to work well with themes and sizing.

---

## And much more...

- üêõ [Hundreds of bug-fixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1).
- ‚ú® Many docs improvements: new pages, more examples, more props documented, and search.
- üêõ Much improved install experience and many bugs fixed with Next, Webpack, Monorepos.

## Acknowledgements

This release once again is inspired by or forks code from a variety of other libraries and developers.

I'd like to thank:

- [Fenando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) and [Moti](https://moti.fyi) for the elegant reanimated animation driver that served as the starting point of `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`, as well as for putting together [Solito](https://solito.dev) that powers the first template in create-tamagui-app.
- [Matt Perry](https://twitter.com/mattgperry) and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the base of AnimatePresence in `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
