description: Easy configuration and themes with @tamagui/config/v4
---

Tamagui is flexible, but it's nice to have sensible defaults. We've been publishing those defaults under `@tamagui/config`, but until version 4 they were a bit of a "take it or leave it" affair.

Version 4 simplifies the config, and adds `createThemeSuite`, a helper function that can generate beautiful themes with just a few lines of code.
