**See [tamagui.dev](https://tamagui.dev) for documentation.**

Tamagui lets you share more code between web and native apps without sacrificing the two things that typically suffer when you do: performance and code quality.

It does this with an optimizing compiler that outputs platform-specific optimizations, turning even cross-module-imported, logic-infused, inline-styled components into clean, flat DOM + CSS on the web, or on native, hoisted style objects and View/Text. The compiler is also optional, as Tamagui also works entirely at runtime.

For example, within the ~500pxÂ² responsive browser section on [the homepage](https://tamagui.dev), 49 of the 55 or so inline styled components are flattened to a `div`. The homepage gains nearly 15% on Lighthouse just by turning on the compiler.

## Installing Tamagui

To install Tamagui with all its components run:

```bash
npm install tamagui @tamagui/config
```

Next, create a Tamagui config file named `tamagui.config.ts`:

```ts
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v2'

import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)
// this makes typescript properly type everything based on the config

type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig

declare module 'tamagui' {

  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}

}
export default tamaguiConfig
// depending on if you chose tamagui, @tamagui/core, or @tamagui/web
// be sure the import and declare module lines both use that same name
```

**Note:** The `v2` config imports the css driver on web and react-native on native. For react-native, import the `@tamagui/config/v2-native` config, and for reanimated, import the `@tamagui/config/v2-reanimated` config.

### Usage

To use Tamagui in your Expo or Next.js projects, all you need to do is wrap your application in the `TamaguiProvider`:

```tsx
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
// only import this from your web app, not native
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'
import tamaguiConfig from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={tamaguiConfig}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

Done! Now try out some components:

```tsx
import { Button, Text } from 'tamagui'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Button>
      <Text>My button</Text>
    </Button>
  );
}
```
